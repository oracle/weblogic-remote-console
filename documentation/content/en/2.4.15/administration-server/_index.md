WebLogic Remote Console connects directly to a WebLogic Administration Server to view and edit its domain.

WebLogic Remote Console administers your domain by connecting to its Administration Server through REST APIs generated by WebLogic Server RESTful management services. The WebLogic RESTful management services dynamically generate REST resources mapped from WebLogic Server MBeans. WebLogic Remote Console builds upon these REST resources to produce a graphical user interface that reflects the MBean structure of your domain and that can connect to domains running remotely.

See [About the WLS RESTful Management Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-remote-console/administer&id=WLRUR-GUID-B193E8EF-1912-48D1-8FB9-99C5ADACCC3B) in **Administering Oracle WebLogic Server with RESTful Management Services** for more information.

For an overview of WebLogic Server domains, their contents, and general guidance on domain configuration, see [Understanding Oracle WebLogic Server Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-remote-console/administer&id=DOMCF-GUID-64E1CAC9-78A5-491C-BE42-6CBB81AA774B) in **Understanding Domain Configuration for Oracle WebLogic Server**.

WebLogic Remote Console is one of several tools available to administer your WebLogic Server domain, each with its own advantages.
