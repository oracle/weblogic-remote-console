The WebLogic Remote Console lets you manage a variety of WebLogic Server configuration tools, called providers. Each provider type offers a different approach for configuring your WebLogic Server domains.

|[Administration Server](administration-server)| Add connections to WebLogic Administration Servers and edit domain configurations in real-time. An alternative to the WebLogic Administration Console. |
|[Property List](property-list)| Create and edit lists of key-value pairs. You can connect property lists to WDT model files as WDT variables to simplify the use of WDT model tokens.|
|[WDT Model File](wdt-model)| Create and edit abstract representations of WebLogic Server domains that you can use to quickly build live domains. |
|[WDT Composite Model File](wdt-composite)| View the combined details of multiple WDT model files at once. |
