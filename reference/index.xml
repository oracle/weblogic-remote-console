      <description>This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the WebLogic Remote Console.
Can I connect the WebLogic Remote Console to domains running in WebLogic on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Yes, you can. First, make sure that the domain&amp;rsquo;s administration server is publicly accessible so the WebLogic Remote Console can establish a connection to the administration server. Then, in the WebLogic Remote Console, enter your credentials and the publicly accessible URL for the WebLogic Administration Server.</description>

Check log files for errors The WebLogic Remote Console provides log files for both front and back end processes. For instructions on how to access these log files, see Check Log Files.
Diagnose invalid WebLogic configuration issues Administration Server The WebLogic Remote Console catches most validation errors when you click Save, or when you commit the change using the shopping cart.

      <description>WebLogic Server regularly checks domains to ensure they comply with its recommended security policies. If a domain does not meet the recommendations, a security warning is logged and displayed in the WebLogic Remote Console.
You must have the July 2021 Patch Set Update (PSU) for WebLogic Server applied to your domain to receive security warnings.
 When there are active security warnings in your domain, a banner with red text appears at the top of the WebLogic Remote Console window.</description>
