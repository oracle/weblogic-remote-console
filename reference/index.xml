      <description>WebLogic Server regularly checks domains to ensure they comply with its recommended security policies. If a domain does not meet the recommendations, a security warning is logged and displayed in the WebLogic Remote Console.
You must have the July 2021 Patch Set Update (PSU) for WebLogic Server applied to your domain to receive security warnings.
 When there are active security warnings in your domain, a banner with red text appears at the top of the WebLogic Remote Console window.</description>
