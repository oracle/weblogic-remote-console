  <p>This page indicates on which WebLogic Server instances or clusters the
      mail session is accessible. Only applications that have been deployed to
      the selected servers or clusters can use this mail session.</p>
      <p>When you target all or part of a cluster, the Administration Console
      initiates a two-phase deployment. In general, such a deployment ensures
      that if the deployment fails for one active server, it fails for all
      active servers.</p>
