  <p>Use this page to define upper and lower byte and/or message thresholds
  for the uniform distributed topic. Exceeding these thresholds will
  trigger events such as generating log messages and starting message flow
  control. You can also specify a maximum size allowed for messages on the
  queue and select a pre-configured quota, which determines the maximum
  number of bytes or messages that the distributed topic is allowed to
  store to conserve memory use.</p>
