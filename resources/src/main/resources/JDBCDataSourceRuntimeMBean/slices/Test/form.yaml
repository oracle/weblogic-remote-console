  <p>Reload this page to test the data source again.</p>
  <p>Note: this page tests the existing connections to the database.
  If you change the data source's configuration (e.g. password), the
  existing connections will still use the old configuration.
  The new configuration will not be tested until the data source needs to
  make a new connection (e.g. if you shutdown then restart the data source).
