# Note - the WLS console hides the actions of UCP data sources.
# Also, it calls DataSourceRuntimeMBean.isOperationAllowed to
# find out whether the data source currently supports the action.
# Also, the JDBCDataSourceRuntimeMBean doesn't have a property that
# indicates if it's UCP, so the WLS console looks at its
# corresponding config mbean.
#
# It would be a lot of work to mimic this in the remote console.
# The proper way to do it is to add custom properties for each
# action that indicate whether the action can be invoked, and to
# have each action 'usedIf' the corresponding property.
#
# For now, the actions just copy DataSourceRuntimeMBean.isOperationAllowed logic.
