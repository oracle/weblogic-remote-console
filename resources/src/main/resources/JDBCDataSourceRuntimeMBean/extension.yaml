    <p>Starts a data source that has a health state of <code>Shutdown</code>.</p>

- name: "suspend"
  type: "void"
  descriptionHTML: >
    <p>Synchronously, gracefully suspends a data source that has the health state of
    <code>Running</code> and  disables existing connections.
    This operation immediately marks the data source as suspended and no further connections are created.
    Idle (not reserved) connections are marked as disabled.
    After a timeout period for the suspend operation,
    all remaining connections in the pool are marked as suspended
    and the following exception is thrown for any operations on the connection,
    indicating that the data source is suspended:
    java.sql.SQLRecoverableException: Connection has been administratively disabled. Try later.
    If graceful suspend is done as part of a graceful shutdown operation,
    connections are immediately closed when no longer reserved or at the end of the timeout period.
    If not done as part of a shutdown operation, these connections remain in the pool and
    are not closed because the pool may be resumed.</p>
    <p>By default, the timeout period is 60 seconds.
    You can change the value of this timeout period by configuring or dynamically
    setting Inactive Connection Timeout Seconds to a non-zero value.</p>
    <p>Setting IgnoreInUseConnectionsEnabled to false causes the operation to fail
    if in-use connections exist.</p>
    <p>If successful, the health state is set to <code>Suspended</code>.</p>
    <p>This is a privileged operation that can only be invoked by an authorized user.</p>

    <p>Gracefully, synchronously shuts down a data source that has a health state of <code>Running</code>.
    A graceful (non-forced) datasource shutdown operation involves first gracefully suspending
    the data source and then releasing the associated resources including the connections.
    After the datasource is gracefully suspended, all remaining in-use connections are closed and
    the datasource is marked as shut down.</p>
