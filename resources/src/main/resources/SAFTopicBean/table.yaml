  <p>This page summarizes the SAF (store-and-forward) topics that have
  been created for a group of SAF imported destinations. A JMS topic
  identifies a publish/subscribe destination type. SAF topics are used for
  asynchronous and disconnected peer communications. Messages delivered to
  a SAF topic are temporarily stored for future delivery and are forwarded
  to a JMS topic on a remote server or cluster when it is reachable.</p>
