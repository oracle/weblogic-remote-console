  <p>Manage this list of RMI forwarding configurations.</p>
  <p>RMI forwarding is a feature that makes cross-domain transactions involving domains
  managed by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator possible without requiring each server in
  a cluster to be individually addressable, where transaction server participants are
  not able to establish connection directly with one another.</p>
  <p>RMI messages destined for a WebLogic server on a host with host name that begins with
  the name of this MBean will be sent to the configured URL. The messages are then
  forwarded to a WebLogic server in the destination domain, and eventually to the
  destination WebLogic server.</p>
