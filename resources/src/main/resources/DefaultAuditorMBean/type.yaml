  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>An Audit Event includes a <code>ContextHandler</code> that can
    hold a variety of information or objects. By default, none of the
    entries in the <code>ContextHandler</code> are audited. Objects in
    the <code>ContextHandler</code> are in most cases logged using the
    <code>toString</code> method. For a list of ContextHandler entries
    supported by the Audit provider, see <i>Configuring Security Providers:
    Configuring the WebLogic Auditing Provider: Configuration Auditing</i>
    in <i>Administering Security for Oracle WebLogic Server</i>.</p>
