  <p>A Role Mapping provider supports dynamic role associations by
  obtaining a computed set of security roles granted to a requester for a
  given WebLogic resource. Authorization providers store their data outside
  of the WebLogic configuration.  For example, the WebLogic XACML Authorization
  provider stores its policies in the domain's embedded LDAP server.</p>
  <p>The WebLogic Remote Console provides pages for managing
  some of the Authorization providers' data.  For example, it
  provides pages for managing the WebLogic XACML Authorization provider's policies.</p>
  <p>This page lists each Authorization provider that has pages for managing its data.
  Navigate to the provider to explore and manage its data.</p>
