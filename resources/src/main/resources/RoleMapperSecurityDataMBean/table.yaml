  <p>A Role Mapping provider supports dynamic role associations by
  obtaining a computed set of security roles granted to a requester for a
  given WebLogic resource. Role Mapping providers store their data outside
  of the WebLogic configuration.  For example, the WebLogic XACML Role Mapping
  provider stores its roles in the domain's embedded LDAP server.</p>
  <p>The WebLogic Remote Console provides pages for managing
  some of the Role Mapping providers' data.  For example, it
  provides pages for managing the WebLogic XACML Role Mapping provider's roles.</p>
  <p>This page lists each Role Mapping provider that has pages for managing its data.
  Navigate to the provider to explore and manage its data.</p>
