  This class is instantiated only on the Administration Server, but you can use it
  to transition the states of Managed Servers as well as Administration Servers.</p>  <p>You
  cannot use it to start an Administration Server, and if you want to use it to start
  Managed Servers, you must first set up a Node Manager on each Managed Server's
  host machine.</p>  <p>If you want to use the methods that transition a server into
  the <code>ADMIN</code> state, you must first set up an administration channel for
  that server.</p>"

# ServerRuntimeMBean allows Admin.
# ServerLifeCycleRuntimeMBean allows Operator and Admin.
#
# CombinedServerRuntimeMBean delegates reading all the properties to SRC & SLCRT
# so doesn't need to worry about their roles.
#
# On the other hand, CSRT handles all the actions itself (and the impl forwards
# the action to the SLCRT or SRT as appropriate).
# This means that we need to get the roles right on these actions.
#
# Since all of the CSRT's actions except for restartSSLChannels forward to the SLCRT,
# set CSRT's roles to the same as SLCRT's so that we don't need to specify the
# role on each CSRT action that is forwarded to the SLCRT.
