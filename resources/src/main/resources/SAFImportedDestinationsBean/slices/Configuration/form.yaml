  <p>Use this page to configure SAF imported destinations properties. SAF
  imported destinations are collections of SAF queues and topics
  that locally represent JMS queues or topics on a remote server or
  cluster. Each collection of imported destinations is associated
  with a remote SAF context. They can also share the same JNDI prefix,
  time-to-live default (message expiration time), and SAF error handling
  policy.</p>
