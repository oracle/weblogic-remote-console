  <p>A security realm is a container for the mechanisms--including users,
  groups, security roles, security policies, and security providers--that
  are used to protect WebLogic resources. You can have multiple active
  security realms in a WebLogic Server domain, but only one can be set as
  the default security realm, which is reserved for domain administrative
  purposes.</p><p>This Security Realms page lists each security realm that
  has been configured in this WebLogic Server domain. Click the name of
  the realm to explore and configure that realm.</p>
