- name: ConnectionLoggerEnabled
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether this WebLogic Server domain should log accepted
    connections.</p>

- name: ConnectionFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The name of the Java class that implements a connection filter
    (that is, the<code> weblogic.security.net.ConnectionFilter</code>
    interface). If no class name is specified, no connection filter will
    be used.</p>

- name: ConnectionFilterRules
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The rules used by any connection filter that implements the
    <code>ConnectionFilterRulesListener</code> interface. When using
    the default implementation and when no rules are specified, all
    connections are accepted. The default implementation rules are in
    the format: <code>target localAddress localPort </code><code>action
    protocol</code><code>s</code>.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>The syntax of the rules is as follows:</p><ul><li>Each rule must
    be written on a single line in the source code.</li><li>Tokens
    in a rule are separated by white space.</li><li>A pound sign
    (#) is the comment character. Everything after a pound sign on
    a line is ignored.</li><li>Whitespace before or after a rule
    is ignored.</li><li>Lines consisting only of whitespace or
    comments are skipped</li></ul><p>All rules have the following
    format:</p><p><code>t<code>a</code></code><code>rget localAddress
    localPort action protocols </code></p><p>where</p><p><code>target
    </code>specifies one or more servers to filter.</p><p><code>localAddress
    </code>defines the host address of the server. (If you
    specify an asterisk (*), the match returns all local IP
    addresses.)</p><p><code>localPort</code> defines the port on which
    the server is listening. (If you specify an asterisk, the match
    returns all available ports on the server).</p><p><code>action
    </code>specifies the action to perform. (The value must be allow
    or deny).</p><p><code>protocols </code>is the list of protocol
    names to match. (One of the following protocols must be specified:
    http, https, t3, t3s, giop, giops, dcom, or ftp.) If no protocol is
    defined, all protocols will match a rule.</p><p>Two kinds of rules
    are recognized:</p><ul><li>A fast rule applies to a host name or IP
    address with optional netmask. If a host name corresponds to multiple IP
    addresses, multiple rules are generated.</li><li>A slow rule applies to
    part of a domain name. Since a rule requires a connect-time DNS lookup
    to perform a match, slow rules impact performance.</li></ul>
