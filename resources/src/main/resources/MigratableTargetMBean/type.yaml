  # We can't specify optionsMethod here since UserPreferredServer is also on the
  # create form, and the optionsMethod needs to be able to get to the MigratableTarget's
  # cluster, but can't because the migratable target doesn't exist yet.
  # We can't just remove UserPreferredServer from the create form and
  # have the user specify it later because there's an mbean check that
  # won't let us save (v.s. commit) the configuration unless the new
  # migratable target has specified a UserPreferredServer.
  # Also, it would require a lot of custom code to turn this into
  # a multi-step wizard where first the user selects the cluster
  # then selects one of the cluster's servers.
  # Instead, don't specify optionsMethod here so that the create form
  # works and specify it in form.yaml since it works there.
  # This means that we'll present a restricted list of servers
  # once the mbean exists, but we'll let the user select any server
  # during create.
