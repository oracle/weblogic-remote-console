introductionHTML: >
  <p>This page allows you to configure a migratable target, including
  specifying a preferred host server in the cluster and selecting candidate
  servers to use as a backup for services on this migratable target. For
  automatic service migration, you need to select the appropriate automatic
  migration policy. You can also optionally provide the appropriate
  pre-migration and post-migration scripts to move a persistent store's
  data across migrated servers. There are also options to have a migratable
  target with a failed service deactivated and reactivated in place,
  instead of being migrated.</p>
