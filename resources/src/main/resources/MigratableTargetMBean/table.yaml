  <p>This page allows you to customize the column display in the table,
  create a new migratable target, and delete a migratable target. A
  migratable target is a target that is active on at-most one server of a
  cluster at a time and which controls the servers that can host a pinned
  migratable service. Migratable services include JMS servers, SAF agents,
  path service, and custom persistent stores. You can manually migrate
  a migratable target or you configure it for automatic migration.</p>
