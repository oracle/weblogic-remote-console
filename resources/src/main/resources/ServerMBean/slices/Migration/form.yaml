introductionHTML: >
  <p>If a clustered server fails, WebLogic Server can automatically restart
  (migrate) the server and its services on another machine. Alternatively,
  you can configure options for the JMS-related services (such as JMS
  servers, SAF agents, path service, and custom persistent stores) and
  the JTA Transaction Recovery Service on this server so that they can
  be manually migrated to another server. You can also specify to have
  the JTA Transaction Recovery Service automatically migrated to another
  server.</p><p>Use this page to enable server migration or to configure
  services-only migration.</p>
