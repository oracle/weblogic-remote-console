  <p><i>Keystores</i> ensure the secure storage and management of private
  keys and trusted certificate authorities (CAs). This page lets you view
  and define various keystore configurations. These settings help you to
  manage the security of message transmissions.</p>
  <p>WebLogic Server is configured with a default keystore configuration.
  Depending on the domain's security configuration, it either uses KSS demo
  identity and trust keystores or it uses JKS demo identity and trust
  keystores a well as the standard java trust JKS keystore. The default
  keystore configuration is appropriate for testing and development
  purposes. However, these keystores should not be used in a production
  environment.</p>
  <p>After you configure identity and trust keystores for a WebLogic Server
  instance, you can configure its SSL attributes. These attributes include
  information about the identity and trust location for particular server
  instances. Use the <b>SSL</b> page to specify this
  information.</p>
  <p>For purposes of backward compatibility, WebLogic Server lets you store
  private keys and trusted certificates authorities in files or in a
  keystore provider. If you use either of these mechanisms for identity and
  trust, choose the Files or Keystore Providers (Deprecated) option on the
  <b>SSL</b> page.</p>
