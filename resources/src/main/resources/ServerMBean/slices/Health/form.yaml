introductionHTML: >
  <p>WebLogic Server provides a self-health monitoring capability to
  improve the reliability and availability of servers in a WebLogic Server
  domain. Selected subsystems within each server monitor their health
  status based on criteria specific to the subsystem.</p><p>Use this page
  to configure the frequency of this server's automated health checks
  and the frequency with which the Node Manager application (optional)
  checks the server's health state. You can also use this page to specify
  whether Node Manager automatically stops and restarts the server if
  the server reaches the "failed" health state.</p>
