introductionHTML: >
  <p>JMS servers act as management containers for the queues and topics
  in JMS modules that are targeted to them. A JMS server's primary
  responsibility for its destinations is to maintain information on what
  persistent store is used for any persistent messages that arrive on
  the destinations, and to maintain the states of durable subscribers
  created on the destinations.</p><p>Use this page to define the general
  configuration parameters for this JMS server.</p>
