  <p>Use this page to select the server instance, cluster, or migratable
  target on which you want to deploy this JMS server. Migratable
  targets define a set of WebLogic Server instances in a cluster that can
  potentially host a pinned messaging service, such as a JMS server. When
  a target server or migratable target boots, the JMS server boots as
  well. If no target server instance or migratable target is specified,
  the JMS server will not boot.</p>
