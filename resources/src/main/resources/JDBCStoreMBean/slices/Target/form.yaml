introductionHTML: >
  <p>This page configures which WebLogic Server, migratable target, or cluster
     hosts this JDBC store. The target must match the target of the
     JMS Servers, SAF Agents, or Path Services that use the store. </p>
  <p><strong>Policy Best Practice:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Distribution and Migration policies only apply when targeting to a cluster.</li>
            <li>A 'Distributed' Distribution Policy is required for JDBC Stores that
                will host JMS Server distributed or SAF Agent imported destinations. This
                creates an instance of the store for each cluster member.</li>
            <li>A 'Singleton' Distribution Policy is required for JDBC Stores that will
                host Singleton JMS Server destinations or the Path Service. This
                creates a single instance of the store in the cluster.</li>
            <li>An 'On-Failure' or 'Always' Migration Policy is required when setting a 'Singleton'
                Distribution policy, or when enabling automatic service migration.</li>
            <li>An 'On-Failure' or 'Always' migration policy requires configuring leasing on the cluster.</li>
          </ul>
