introductionHTML: >
  <p>Use this page to configure the high availability (HA) settings for a
      cluster-targeted JDBC store, or for a standalone-server-targeted JDBC
      store. If the store is targeted to a migratable target, then configure the
      HA settings on the migratable target instead. </p>
  <p><strong>Policy Best Practice:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Distribution and Migration policies only apply when targeting to a cluster.</li>
            <li>A 'Distributed' Distribution Policy is required for JDBC Stores that
                will host JMS Server distributed or SAF Agent imported destinations. This
                creates an instance of the store for each cluster member.</li>
            <li>A 'Singleton' Distribution Policy is required for JDBC Stores that will
                host Singleton JMS Server destinations or the Path Service. This
                creates a single instance of the store in the cluster.</li>
            <li>An 'On-Failure' or 'Always' Migration Policy is required when setting a 'Singleton'
                Distribution policy, or when enabling automatic service migration.</li>
            <li>An 'On-Failure' or 'Always' migration policy requires configuring leasing on the cluster.</li>
          </ul>
