      <p>Create a new JDBC Store. Best Practices (scroll to see all): </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefix Name:</strong>Configure a unique table 'Prefix Name' for each JDBC store.
            Different JDBC Store instances cannot share the same backing table.</li>
        <li><strong>Target:</strong> Must match the target of the JMS Servers, SAF Agents, or Path Services
            that will use the store.</li>
        <li><strong>Policies:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The Distribution and Migration policies only apply when targeting to a cluster.</li>
            <li>A 'Distributed' Distribution Policy is required for JDBC Stores that
                will host JMS Server distributed or SAF Agent imported destinations. This
                creates an instance of the store for each cluster member.</li>
            <li>A 'Singleton' Distribution Policy is required for JDBC Stores that will
                host Singleton JMS Server destinations or the Path Service. This
                creates a single instance of the store in the cluster.</li>
            <li>An 'On-Failure' or 'Always' Migration Policy is required when setting a 'Singleton'
                Distribution policy, or when enabling automatic service migration.</li>
            <li>An 'On-Failure' or 'Always' migration policy requires configuring leasing on the cluster.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
