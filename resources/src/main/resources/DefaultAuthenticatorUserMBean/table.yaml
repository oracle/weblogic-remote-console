introductionHTML: >
  <p>This page displays information about each user that has been configured
  in this WebLogic Authentication provider.</p>
  <p>Users are entities that can be authenticated.
  A user can be a person or software entity, such as a Java client.
  Each user is given a unique identity within a security realm.
  Oracle recommends assigning users to groups for two reasons:
  it makes the WebLogic Security Service perform better,
  and makes it more efficient for administrators who work with large numbers of users.</p>
