instanceName: Web Single Sign-on Identity Provider Partner

properties:
- name: WantAuthnRequestsSigned
  label: "Only Accept Signed Authentication Requests"
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether authentication requests sent to this Identity
    Provider partner must be signed.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If this attribute is set to <code>true</code>, authentication
    requests sent to this Identity Provider partner are signed, even if
    the SAML 2.0 Service Provider configuration for the local site are not
    set to automatically sign authentication requests.</p>
    <p>Operations on this parameter are available in the <code>com.bea.security.saml2.providers.registry.WebSSOIdPPartner</code> interface.</p>
- name: RedirectURIs
  label: "Redirect URIs"
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An optional set of URIs from which unauthenticated users will be
    redirected to the Identity Provider partner.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>Note the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A URI may include a wildcard pattern, but the wildcard pattern
      must include a file type to match specific files in a directory. For
      example, to create a match for all files in the
      <code>/targetapp</code> directory, including all <code>.jsp</code>,
      <code>.html</code>, and <code>.htm</code> files, the following
      wildcard patterns are specified:<blockquote>
          <p><code>/targetapp/*</code><br /><code>/targetapp/*.jsp</code><br /><code>/targetapp/*.html</code><br /><code>/targetapp/*.htm</code></p>
        </blockquote></li>
      <li>If two or more Identity Provider partners are configured that
      are capable of authenticating a user for a given URI in this list,
      the authentication request is sent to the first matching partner
      that the SAML 2.0 services finds.</li>
      <li>The use of Redirect URIs is only one mechanism for enabling a
      Service Provider initiated web single sign-on session. Another is to
      embed the Service Provider initiator service URI (by default, this
      is <code>sp/sso/initiator</code>) in the URI of the requested resource.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Operations on this parameter are available in the <code>com.bea.security.saml2.providers.registry.WebSSOIdPPartner</code> interface.</p>
