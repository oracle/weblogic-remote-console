  <p>This page creates a credential mapping, which enables you to map a
  WebLogic Server user ID to a remote system user ID, typically a database
  user account.</p>
  <p>If credential mapping is enabled on the data source, when an
  application requests a database connection from the data source, WebLogic
  Server determines the current WebLogic Server user ID and then sets the
  mapped database ID as a light-weight client ID on the database
  connection.</p>
