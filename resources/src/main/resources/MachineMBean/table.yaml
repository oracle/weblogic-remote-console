  <p>A machine is the logical representation of the computer that hosts
  one or more WebLogic Server instances (servers). WebLogic Server
  uses configured machine names to determine the optimum server in a
  cluster to which certain tasks, such as HTTP session replication, are
  delegated. The Administration Server uses the machine definition in
  conjunction with Node Manager to start remote servers.</p><p>This page
  displays key information about each machine that has been configured
  in the current WebLogic Server domain.</p>
