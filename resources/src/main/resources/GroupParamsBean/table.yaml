  <p>JMS templates can specify subdeployments for error destinations so that
      any number of destination subdeployments (groups of queue or topics) will
      use only the error destinations specified in the corresponding template
      subdeployments.</p>
      <p>This page summarizes the error destination subdeployments that have
      been configured for the current JMS template.</p>
