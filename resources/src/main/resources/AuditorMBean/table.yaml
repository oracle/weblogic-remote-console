  <p>An Auditing provider collects, stores, and distributes information
  about operating requests and the outcome of those requests for the
  purposes of non-repudiation. An Auditing provider can also handle
  information about configuration changes for auditing purposes. You can
  configure multiple Auditing providers in a security realm, but none
  are required. The default security realm does not include an Auditing
  provider.</p>
