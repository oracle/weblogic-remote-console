  The filter expression is specified as a string in the query language. The
  query language supports Boolean operators: AND, OR, and NOT, and relational
  operators. You can use the following column message attributes in a
  query to filter data going to a log destination: RECORDID, DATE, SEVERITY,
  SUBSYSTEM, MACHINE, SERVER, THREAD, USERID, TXID, CONTEXTID, TIMESTAMP, MSGID,
  and MESSAGE.  For example, this is a valid expression:
  <pre>
    (SEVERITY = 'Warning') AND (MSGID = 'BEA-320012')
  </pre>
  <p>
