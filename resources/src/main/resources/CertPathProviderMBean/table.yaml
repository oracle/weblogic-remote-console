  <p>A Certification Path provider completes and validates certificate
  chains by using trusted Certificate Authority based checking. The
  provider checks the signatures in the chain, ensures that the chain has
  not expired, and checks that one of the certificates in the chain is
  issued by one of the server's trusted Certificate Authorities. If any
  of these checks fail, the chain is not valid. The provider optionally
  checks the certificate chain's basic constraints.</p>
