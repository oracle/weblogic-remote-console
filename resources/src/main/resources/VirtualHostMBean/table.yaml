  <p>A virtual host is a set of host names to which WebLogic Server
  instances (servers) or clusters respond. When you use virtual hosting,
  you use DNS to specify one or more host names that map to the IP address
  of a server or cluster. You also specify which Web applications are
  served by each virtual host.</p><p>This page summarizes the virtual
  host instances that have been configured for the current domain.</p>
