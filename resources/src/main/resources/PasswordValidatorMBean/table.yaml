  <p>The Password Validation provider manages and enforces a set of
  configurable password composition rules. When configured in a security
  realm, the Password Validation provider is automatically invoked by
  a supported authentication provider whenever a password is created or
  updated for a user in the realm. The Password Validation provider then
  performs a check to determine whether the password meets the criteria
  established by the composition rules, and the password is accepted or
  rejected as appropriate.</p>
