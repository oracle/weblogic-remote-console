  <p>An Authentication provider allows WebLogic Server to establish trust
  by validating a user. Authentication providers store their data
  outside of the WebLogic configuration.  For example, the WebLogic
  Authentication provider stores its users and groups in the domain's
  embedded LDAP server.</p>
  <p>The WebLogic Remote Console provides pages for managing
  some of the Authentication providers' data.  For example, it
  provides pages for managing the WebLogic Authentication provider's
  users and groups, but doesn't provide pages for managing an
  external LDAP Authenticator's users and groups.</p>
  <p>This page lists each security provider that has pages for managing its data.
  Click the name of the provider to explore and manage its data.</p>
