  <p>A Role Mapping provider supports dynamic role associations by
  obtaining a computed set of security roles granted to a requester for a
  given WebLogic resource. You must have one Role Mapping provider in a
  security realm, and you can configure multiple Role Mapping providers
  in a security realm.</p><p>When one or more Role Mapping providers
  are configured, this Role Mappers page displays key information about
  each of them. To configure a Role Mapping provider, click the name of
  the provider.</p>
