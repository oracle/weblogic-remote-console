  helpHTML: >
    <p>Allows for updating an application configuration using an changed
    deployment plan.</p>
    <p>A configuration update is equivalent to replacing the application's
    deployment plan. The deployment plan is redeployed in-place. A new
    version of the application is not started, even if the new deployment
    plan has a different version.</p>
    <p>The update succeeds only if changes to the deployment plan do not
    require the application to be restarted. Configuration changes in 
    the new deployment plan must be limited to
    tuning the application. Changes to resource bindings causes
    the update to fail. Use redeploy()
    to apply resource binding changes to a production application.</p>
    <p>This method targets only root modules. Module level targeting is 
    not supported.</p>
