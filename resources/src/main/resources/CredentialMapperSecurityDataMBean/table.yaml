  <p>A Credential Mapping provider allows WebLogic Server to log
  into a remote system on behalf of a subject that has already been
  authenticated.  Credential Mapping providers store their data outside
  of the WebLogic configuration.  For example, the Default Credential Mapping
  provider stores its mappings in the domain's embedded LDAP server.</p>
  <p>The WebLogic Remote Console provides pages for managing
  some of the Credential Mapping providers' data.  For example, it
  provides pages for managing the Default Credential Mapping provider's mappings.</p>
  <p>This page lists each Credential Mapping provider that has pages for managing its data.
  Navigate to the provider to explore and manage its data.</p>
