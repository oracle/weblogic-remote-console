  <p>Manages this domain's dashboards.</p>
  <p>Note: Custom filtering dashboards are used to display all the instances
  in the domain that match a type (e.g. Application Runtime) and a set of
  user-defined filters (e.g. the HealthState is not ok and the application's
  name contains the string 'med').</p>
  <p>To create one, choose a node from the Navigation tree then click the 'New Dashboard' button.
  For example, to create a custom filtering dashboard of Application Runtime instances,
  navigate to 'Deployments -> Application Runtimes' then click 'New Dashboard'.</p>
