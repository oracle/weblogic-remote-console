  <p>Use this page to target a messaging bridge instance to independent
    servers, clusters, or migratable targets.</p>
  <p><b>Note: </b>A best practice is to target your message bridge to a
    cluster. Migratable targets define a set of WebLogic Server instances in a
    cluster that can potentially host JMS as an "exactly-once" service. Unlike
    applications, exactly-once services are not active on all server instances
    in a cluster. They are instead "pinned" to a single server in the cluster
    to preserve data consistency.</p>
