  <p>A security realm is a container for the mechanisms--including users,
  groups, security roles, security policies, and security providers--that
  are used to protect WebLogic resources.
  Security providers store their data outside of the WebLogic configuration.
  For example, the WebLogic Authentication provider stores
  its users and groups in the domain's embedded LDAP server.</p>
  <p>This page lists each security realm that has been configured in this
  WebLogic Server domain.  Click the name of the realm to explore and manage
  its security providers' data.</p>
