  <p>This page indicates on which WebLogic Server instances or clusters the
      managed thread factory template is accessible. Only applications that have
      been deployed to the selected servers or clusters can use this managed
      thread factory template.</p>
      <p>When you target all or part of a cluster, the Administration Console
      initiates a two-phase deployment. In general, such a deployment ensures
      that if the deployment fails for one active server, it fails for all
      active servers.</p>
