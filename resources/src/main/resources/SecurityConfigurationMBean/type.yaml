  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The security realm that should be used as the default administrative
    realm for this WebLogic Server domain.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>All available security realms are listed on the pull-down menu. If
    you configure a new security realm, but do not configure any security
    providers or all the required security providers, the security realm
    will not be available from the pull-down menu. In order for a security
    realm to be valid, you must configure an Authentication provider, an
    Authorization provider, an Adjudication provider, a Credential Mapping
    provider, a CertPathBuilder, and a Role Mapping provider.</p>

- name: AdministrativeIdentityDomain
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The domain's administrative identity domain.</p>

- name: IdentityDomainAwareProvidersRequired
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether all role mapping, authorization, credential
    mapping, and audit providers configured in the domain must support the
    <code>IdentityDomainAwareProviderMBean</code> interface's administrative
    identity domain.</p>

# deprecated
# - name: AnonymousAdminLookupEnabled
#   helpSummaryHTML: >
#     <p>Specifies whether anonymous, read-only access to WebLogic Server
#     MBeans should be allowed from the <code>MBeanHome</code> API.</p>
#
#   helpDetailsHTML: >
#     <p>With anonymous access enabled, you can see the value of any MBean
#     attribute that is not explicitly marked as protected by the WebLogic
#     Server MBean authorization process. This attribute should be enabled
#     only for backward compatibility.</p>

- name: CrossDomainSecurityEnabled
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether or not cross-domain security is enabled for the
    domain.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If you enable cross-domain security, you need to add one or more
    cross-domain users and specify a credential mapping that includes the
    credentials for each remote domain user that is authorized to access
    this domain.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>The list can either be semicolon-separated domain names on the same
    line or could be one domain name per line or could be a combination
    of both.</p>

- name: WebAppFilesCaseInsensitive
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies the case sensitive URL-pattern matching behavior for
    security-constraints, servlets, filters, virtual-hosts, etc. in the
    webapp container and external security policies. The valid values are
    <code>os</code>, <code>true</code>, or <code>false</code>. <b>Note:</b>
    This is a Windows-only flag that is provided for backward compatibility
    when upgrading from pre-9.0 versions of WebLogic Server. On Unix
    platforms, setting this value to <code>true</code> causes undesired
    behavior.</p>
  legalValues:
  - value: os
    label: OS
  - value: "true"
    label: True
  - value: "false"
    label: False

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>When the value is set to <code>os</code>, the pattern matching is case
    sensitive on all platforms except Windows. (Note that on non-Windows
    platforms, WebLogic Server does not enforce case sensitivity and
    relies on the file system for optimization. As a result, if you have
    a Windows Samba mount from UNIX or Mac OS that have been installed
    in case-insensitive mode, there is a chance of a security risk. If
    so, specify case insensitive lookups by setting this attribute to
    <code>true</code>.) This property also preserves backward compatibility
    on Windows file systems only. Prior to version 9.0, WebLogic Server
    was case insensitive on Windows platforms. However, as of WebLogic
    Server 9.0, URL-pattern matching is strictly enforced. During the
    upgrade of older domains, the value of this parameter is explicitly
    set to <code>os</code> by the upgrade plug-in to preserve backward
    compatibility.</p><p><b>Note: </b>Setting this flag to <code>true</code>
    on Unix platforms causes undesired behavior and is not supported.</p>

- name: EnforceStrictURLPattern
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether the system should enforce strict URL pattern.,
    " / " to represent the entire contents of a Web Application.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>This property is provided for backward compatibility with version
    8.1. When this field is checked the system enforces the use of the " /
    " character as the default representation of an entire Web application
    in the security container. This is the standard Java EE syntax and is
    consistent with the syntax used by the Servlet container. In version
    8.1 the security container used " /* " as the default representation of
    an entire Web application. If you want your applications to continue
    to use " /* " in this context you must change the value to false
    (unchecked). When set to false, the security container recognizes " /*
    " as the equivalent of " / " , thereby ensuring consistency with the
    Servlet container.</p>

- name: DowngradeUntrustedPrincipals
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether to downgrade to anonymous principals that cannot
    be verified.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>This feature is useful for server-server communication between
    untrusted domains.</p>

- name: CompatibilityConnectionFiltersEnabled
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether this WebLogic Server domain enables compatibility
    with previous connection filters.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>Checking or unchecking this fields changes the protocols names used
    when filtering needs to be performed.</p>

- name: ClearTextCredentialAccessEnabled
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether credential access in clear text is
    allowed. This can be overridden by the system property
    <code>-Dweblogic.management.clearTextCredentialAccessEnabled</code>.</p>

- name: UseKSSForDemo
