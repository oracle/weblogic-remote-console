# It would be good to get to the particular channel, but we can't without a
# customizer, because the names are different.  The runtime mbeans have
# names like "Default[t3][1]", as opposed to the configuration which is just
# t3.  It is not a big deal, though, because we can get to the right table
# and clicking on "t3" is not a huge burden.
