properties:

- name: Host
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The host name of the computer on which the LDAP server is running.</p>

- name: Port
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The port number on which the LDAP server is listening.</p>

- name: Principal
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The Distinguished Name (DN) of the LDAP user that WebLogic Server
    should use to connect to the LDAP server.</p>

- name: Credential
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The credential (usually a password) used to connect to the LDAP
    server.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If this password has not been set, WebLogic Server generates
    a password at startup, initializes the attribute, and saves the
    configuration to the config.xml file. If you want to connect to the
    embedded LDAP server using an external LDAP browser and the embedded
    LDAP administrator account (cn=Admin), change this attribute from the
    generated value.</p>

- name: SSLEnabled
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether the SSL protocol should be used when connecting
    to the LDAP server.</p>

- name: UsernameAttribute
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies the attribute on the LDAP object for the user that contains
    the user's name.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>The user's name should appear in the Subject. This setting defines
    how to find the user's name. Typically, the setting matches the User
    Name setting of the LDAP Authentication provider configured for use
    with this LDAP X509 Identity Assertion provider.</p>

- name: UserFilterAttributes
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies how to select the LDAP object for the user from the LDAP
    objects beneath the base LDAP DN defined in the Certificate Mapping
    attribute. This setting defines how to find the LDAP object from the
    certificate's Subject DN.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>The LDAP object's class must be person. This attribute contains
    an array of strings, each of which is an attribute that the LDAP
    object must match.</p><p>Typically, the value of this attribute
    is the LDAP object that matches the value of an attribute in the
    certificate's Subject DN. For example:</p><p>The uid attribute of
    the LDAP user object matches the Subject DN attribute, if the syntax
    is:</p><p><tt>LDAPATTRNAME=$subj.SUBJECDNATTRNAME</tt></p><p>For example:
    <tt>uid=$subj.DN</tt></p><p>This option is very similar to the User Name
    Filter option on LDAP Authentication providers which maps a username
    to a search filter. The differences are:</p><ul><li>This option maps
    a certificate's Subject DN to a filter and the LDAP Authentication
    provider uses a single string giving the system administrator complete
    control over the filter.</li><li>The LDAP X509 Authentication provider
    adds <tt>objectclass=person</tt> to the filter and uses an array of
    strings that are combined.</li></ul>

- name: CertificateAttribute
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies the attribute on the LDAP object for the user that
    contains the user's certificate. This option defines how to find
    the certificate. Valid values are <tt>userCertificate</tt> and
    <tt>userCertificate;binary</tt>.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <ul><li>If you use the LDAP browser to load a certificate into the
    LDAP directory, an attribute <tt>userCertificate</tt> of type binary
    is created. To access the certificate, define this option as<tt>
    userCertificate</tt>.</li><li>If you use <code>ldapmodify</code> to
    create the Certificate Attribute, a <tt>userCertificate;binary</tt>
    is created when the certificate data is loaded in the LDAP
    directory. To access the certificate, define this option as
    <tt>userCertificate;binary</tt>.</li></ul>

- name: CertificateMapping
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies how to construct the base LDAP DN used to locate the LDAP
    object for the user. This attribute defines how to find the object from
    the certificate's Subject DN.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>Typically, this value is the same as the User Base DN attribute
    in the LDAP Authentication providers. You may include the fields from
    the Subject DN in this base DN.</p><p>For example: if the Certificate
    subject is <tt>CN=meyer.beasys.com</tt>,<tt> ou=fred, o=BEASYS, L=SFO,
    C=US</tt> and the mapping is <tt>ou=people, ou=$subj.ou</tt>, WebLogic
    Server uses <tt>ou=people, ou=fred, o=BEASYS, c=U</tt><tt>S</tt> as
    the DN when locating the user.</p>

- name: CacheEnabled
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether a cache is used with the LDAP server</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>This is a cache of the LDAP requests.</p>

- name: CacheSize
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The size of the cache (in kilobytes) that is used with the LDAP
    server</p>

- name: IdentityDomain
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The name of the identity domain.</p>
