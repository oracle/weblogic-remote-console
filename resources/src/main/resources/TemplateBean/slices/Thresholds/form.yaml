  <p>Use this page to define upper and lower byte and/or message thresholds
  for destinations created from this template. Exceeding these thresholds
  will trigger events such as generating log messages and starting message
  flow control. You can also specify a maximum size allowed for messages
  on destinations and select a pre-configured quota, which determines the
  maximum number of bytes or messages that the destinations are allowed
  to store to conserve memory use.</p>
