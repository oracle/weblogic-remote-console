properties:

- name: Host
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The host name or IP address of the LDAP server.</p>

- name: Port
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The port number on which the LDAP server is listening.</p>

- name: Principal
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The Distinguished Name (DN) of the LDAP user that WebLogic Server
    should use to connect to the LDAP server.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> The value you enter for <code>principal</code> must
    be an LDAP administrator who has the privilege to search users and
    groups in Active Directory. If the LDAP administrator does not have
    privileges to search Active Directory, an LDAP exception with error
    code 50 is generated.</p>

- name: Credential
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The credential (usually a password) used to connect to the LDAP
    server.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If this password has not been set, WebLogic Server generates
    a password at startup, initializes the attribute, and saves the
    configuration to the config.xml file. If you want to connect to the
    embedded LDAP server using an external LDAP browser and the embedded
    LDAP administrator account (cn=Admin), change this attribute from the
    generated value.</p>

- name: SSLEnabled
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether the SSL protocol should be used when connecting
    to the LDAP server.</p>

- name: AllUsersFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>If the attribute (user object class) is not specified (that is,
    if the attribute is null or empty), a default search filter is created
    based on the user schema.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> Wildcards are permitted in the filter
    specification. However, using multiple wildcards in a given filter has
    a negative performance impact on the LDAP server, so Oracle recommends
    that you limit their use.</p>

- name: UserFromNameFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>If the attribute (user name attribute and user object class) is not
    specified (that is, if the attribute is null or empty), a default search
    filter is created based on the user schema.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> Wildcards are permitted in the filter
    specification. However, using multiple wildcards in a given filter has
    a negative performance impact on the LDAP server, so Oracle recommends
    that you limit their use.</p>

- name: AllGroupsFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An LDAP search filter for finding all groups beneath the base group
    distinguished name (DN). If the attribute is not specified (that is,
    if the attribute is null or empty), a default search filter is created
    based on the Group schema.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> Wildcards are permitted in the filter
    specification. However, using multiple wildcards in a given filter has
    a negative performance impact on the LDAP server, so Oracle recommends
    that you limit their use.</p>

- name: GroupFromNameFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An LDAP search filter for finding a group given the name of the
    group. If the attribute is not specified (that is, if the attribute
    is null or empty), a default search filter is created based on the
    group schema.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> Wildcards are permitted in the filter
    specification. However, using multiple wildcards in a given filter has
    a negative performance impact on the LDAP server, so Oracle recommends
    that you limit their use.</p>

- name: UseTokenGroupsForGroupMembershipLookup
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Indicates whether to use the Active Directory TokenGroups attribute
    lookup algorithm instead of the standard recursive group membership
    lookup algorithm.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>To use this attribute, your Active Directory server must be running
    in Native Mode and you must have implemented security groups in Active
    Directory.</p>

- name: ConnectTimeout
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The maximum time in seconds to wait for the connection to the LDAP
    server to be established. If this attribute is set to 0, there is no
    maximum time limit.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>The default setting is 0, which results in no timeout. This
    default value can result in a slowdown in WebLogic Server
    execution if the LDAP server is unavailable. In addition,
    if WebLogic Server has multiple LDAP Authentication providers
    configured, the failure to connect to one LDAP server may block
    the use of the other LDAP Authentication providers.</p><p>Oracle
    recommends that you specify a non-zero value; for example, 60
    seconds.</p><p>If multiple hosts are specified in <b>Host</b>,
    this value sets the total timeout for making a connection among
    all those hosts. To set a timeout for an individual connection, use the
    <code>-Dweblogic.security.providers.authentication.ldap.socketTimeout=</code><code><i>seconds</i></code>
    security parameter for the JVM in which WebLogic Server runs. Specifying
    the connect timeout in conjunction with the socket timeout is useful
    for configuring failover for an LDAP Authentication provider.</p>

- name: ParallelConnectDelay
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The delay in seconds when making concurrent attempts to connect to
    multiple LDAP servers.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If this attribute is set to 0, connection attempts are serialized. An
    attempt is made to connect to the first server in the list. The next
    entry in the list is tried only if the attempt to connect to the
    current host fails. If this attribute is not set and an LDAP server is
    unavailable, an application may be blocked for a long time. If this
    attribute is greater than 0, another connection is started after the
    specified time.</p>

- name: ResultsTimeLimit
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The maximum number of milliseconds for the LDAP server to wait for
    results before timing out. If this attribute is set to 0, there is no
    maximum time limit.</p>

- name: FollowReferrals
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies that a search for a user or group within the LDAP
    Authentication provider will follow referrals to other LDAP servers
    or branches within the LDAP directory. By default, this attribute
    is enabled.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> If the Microsoft Active Directory LDAP server has
    references, this attribute must be explicitly enabled.</p>

- name: BindAnonymouslyOnReferrals
  helpHTML: >
    <p>By default, the LDAP Authentication provider uses the same DN and
    password used to connect to the LDAP server when following referrals
    during a search. If you want to connect as an anonymous user, enable
    this attribute.</p>

- name: PropagateCauseForLoginException
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether the providers should propagate the cause of the
    LoginException.</p>

- name: CacheEnabled
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether a cache is used with the LDAP server</p>

- name: CacheSize
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The size of the cache (in kilobytes) that is used with the LDAP
    server</p>

- name: IdentityDomain
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The name of the identity domain.</p>

- name: GuidAttribute
  label: GUID Attribute

- name: StaticGroupDNsfromMemberDNFilter
  label: Static Group DNs From Member DN Filter
