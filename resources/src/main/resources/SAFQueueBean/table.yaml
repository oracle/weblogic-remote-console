  <p>This page summarizes the SAF (store-and-forward) queues that have been
  created for a group of SAF imported destinations. A JMS queue defines
  a point-to-point destination type. SAF queues are used for asynchronous
  and disconnected peer communications. Messages delivered to a SAF queue
  are temporarily stored for future delivery and are forwarded to a JMS
  queue on a remote server or cluster when it is reachable.</p>
