  <p>A foreign JNDI provider represents a JNDI tree that can reside
  outside of a WebLogic Server. This could be a JNDI tree in a different
  server environment or within an external Java program. By setting up
  a foreign JNDI provider you can lookup and use an object that exists
  outside of the WebLogic Server environment with the same ease that you
  would use an object bound in your WebLogic Server instance. Use this
  page to configure a foreign JNDI provider.</p>
