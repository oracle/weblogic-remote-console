  <p>A foreign server represents a JNDI provider that resides outside a
  WebLogic Server. It contains information that allows WebLogic Server
  to reach the remote JNDI provider. This way, a number of connection
  factory and destination objects (queues or topics) can be defined on
  one JNDI directory. Use this page to configure a foreign server.</p>
