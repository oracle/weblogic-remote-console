  <p>This page creates the first credential and credential mapping for a remote resource.</p>
  <p>Remote resources with which you communicate via the cross-domain protocol are identified by
  the remote domain name.</p>
  <p>Remote resources with which you communicate via a means other than the cross-domain protocol
  are identified by a combination of protocol, remote host, remote port, path and method.</p>
