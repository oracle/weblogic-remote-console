properties:

- name: Host
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The host name or IP address of the LDAP server.</p>

- name: Port
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The port number on which the LDAP server is listening.</p>

- name: Principal
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The Distinguished Name (DN) of the LDAP user that WebLogic Server
    should use to connect to the LDAP server.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p><b>Note:</b> The value you enter for <code>principal</code> must be
    an LDAP administrator who has the privilege to search users and groups
    in Oracle Unified Directory. If the LDAP administrator does not have
    privileges to search Oracle Unified Directory, an LDAP exception with
    error code 50 is generated.</p>

- name: Credential
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The credential (usually a password) used to connect to the LDAP
    server.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If this password has not been set, WebLogic Server generates
    a password at startup, initializes the attribute, and saves the
    configuration to the config.xml file. If you want to connect to the
    embedded LDAP server using an external LDAP browser and the embedded
    LDAP administrator account (cn=Admin), change this attribute from the
    generated value.</p>

- name: SSLEnabled
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether the SSL protocol should be used when connecting
    to the LDAP server.</p>

- name: AllUsersFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An LDAP search filter for finding all users beneath the base user
    distinguished name (DN). <b>Note:</b> If you change the user name
    attribute to a type other than <code>cn</code>, you must duplicate that
    change in the <b>User From Name Filter</b> and <b>User Name Attribute</b>
    attributes.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>For example, to change the user name attribute
    to <code>uid</code>, specify the search filter as
    <code>(&amp;(<b>uid</b>=*)(objectclass=person))</code>. If the attribute
    is not specified (that is, if the attribute is null or empty), a default
    search filter is created based on the user schema.</p><p>Note also that
    you should limit the use of wildcards in filter expressions. Wildcards
    are permitted, but using multiple wildcards in a given filter expression
    can have a negative performance impact on the LDAP server.</p>

- name: UserFromNameFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An LDAP search filter for finding a user given the name of the
    user. The user name attribute specified in this filter must match the one
    specified in the <b>All Users Filter</b> and <b>User Name Attribute</b>
    attributes.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>For example, to change the user name attribute
    to <code>uid</code>, specify the search filter as
    <code>(&amp;(<b>uid</b>=%u)(objectclass=person))</code>. If the attribute
    (user name attribute and user object class) is not specified (that is,
    if the attribute is null or empty), a default search filter is created
    based on the user schema.</p><p>Note also that you should limit the use
    of wildcards in filter expressions. Wildcards are permitted, but using
    multiple wildcards in a given filter expression can have a negative
    performance impact on the LDAP server.</p>

- name: UserNameAttribute
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The attribute of an LDAP user object class that specifies the
    name of the user. The user name attribute specified must match the
    one specified in the <b>All Users Filter</b> and <b>User From Name
    Filter</b> attributes.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>For example, if the user name attribute is changed from
    <code>cn</code> to <code>uid</code>, you must duplicate that change
    in the <b>All Users Filter</b> and <b>User From Name Filter</b>
    attributes.</p>

- name: AllGroupsFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An LDAP search filter for finding all groups beneath the base
    group distinguished name (DN). The static group object class should be
    modified, as necessary, based on the settings for the <b>Static Group
    Object Class</b> and <b>Static Member DN Attribute</b> attributes.<b>
    </b></p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If the name attribute of a static group object or dynamic
    group object is changed, this search filter must be revised
    accordingly. For example, if the name attribute specified in
    the <b>Static Group Name Attribute</b> attribute is changed from
    <code>cn</code> to <code>uid</code>, this filter should be specified as
    <code>(&amp;(<b>uid</b>=*)(|(objectclass=groupofUniqueNames)(objectclass=orcldynamicgroup)))</code>.</p><p>If
    the attribute is not specified (that is, if the attribute is null
    or empty), a default search filter is created based on the Group
    schema.</p><p>Note also that you should limit the use of wildcards
    in filter expressions. Wildcards are permitted, but using multiple
    wildcards in a given filter expression can have a negative performance
    impact on the LDAP server.</p>

- name: GroupFromNameFilter
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>An LDAP search filter for finding a group given the name of the
    group. The static group object class should be modified, as necessary,
    based on the settings for the <b>Static Group Object Class</b> and
    <b>Static Member DN Attribute</b> attributes.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If the name attribute of a static group object or dynamic
    LDAP group object is changed, this filter must be revised
    accordingly. For example, if the name attribute specified in
    the <b>Dynamic Group Name Attribute</b> attribute is changed from
    <code>cn</code> to <code>uid</code>, this filter should be specified as
    <code>(|(&amp;(cn=%g)(objectclass=groupofUniqueNames))(&amp;(<b>uid</b>=%g)(objectclass=orcldynamicgroup)))</code>.</p><p>If
    this attribute is not specified (that is, if the attribute is null
    or empty), a default search filter is created based on the group
    schema.</p><p>Note also that you should limit the use of wildcards
    in filter expressions. Wildcards are permitted, but using multiple
    wildcards in a given filter expression can have a negative performance
    impact on the LDAP server.</p>

- name: StaticGroupNameAttribute
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The attribute of a static LDAP group object that specifies the name
    of the group. If the name attribute of the static LDAP group object
    is changed -- for example, from <code>cn</code> to <code>uid</code>
    -- that change must be duplicated in the <b>All Groups Filter</b>
    and <b>Group From Name Filter </b>attributes.</p>

- name: DynamicMemberURLAttribute
  offlineName: DynamicMemberUrlAttribute

- name: DynamicGroupNameAttribute
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The attribute of a dynamic LDAP group object that specifies the name
    of the group. If the name attribute of the dynamic LDAP group object
    is changed -- for example, from <code>cn</code> to <code>uid</code>
    -- that change must be duplicated in both the <b>All Groups Filter</b>
    and <b>Group From Name Filter</b> attributes.</p>

- name: ConnectTimeout
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The maximum time in seconds to wait for the connection to the LDAP
    server to be established. If this attribute is set to 0, there is not
    a maximum time limit.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>The default setting is 0. This default value can result in a slowdown
    in WebLogic Server execution if the LDAP server is unavailable. In
    addition, if WebLogic Server has multiple LDAP Authentication providers
    configured, the failure to connect to one LDAP server may block
    the use of the other LDAP Authentication providers.</p><p>Oracle
    recommends that you specify a non-zero value; for example, 60
    seconds.</p><p>If multiple hosts are specified in <b>Host</b>,
    this value sets the total timeout for making a connection among
    all those hosts. To set a timeout for an individual connection, use the
    <code>-Dweblogic.security.providers.authentication.ldap.socketTimeout=<i>seconds</i></code>
    security parameter for the JVM in which WebLogic Server runs. Specifying
    the connect timeout in conjunction with the socket timeout is useful
    for configuring failover for an LDAP Authentication provider.</p>

- name: ParallelConnectDelay
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>The delay in seconds when making concurrent attempts to connect to
    multiple LDAP servers.</p>
  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>If this attribute is set to 0, connection attempts are serialized. An
    attempt is made to connect to the first server in the list. The next
    entry in the list is tried only if the attempt to connect to the
    current host fails. If this attribute is not set and an LDAP server is
    unavailable, an application may be blocked for a long time. If this
    attribute is greater than 0, another connection is started after the
    specified time.</p>

- name: ResultsTimeLimit
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The maximum number of milliseconds for the LDAP server to wait for
    results before timing out. If this attribute is set to 0, there is no
    maximum time limit.</p>

- name: FollowReferrals
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies that a search for a user or group within the LDAP
    Authentication provider will follow referrals to other LDAP servers
    or branches within the LDAP directory. By default, this attribute
    is enabled.</p>

- name: BindAnonymouslyOnReferrals
  helpHTML: >
    <p>By default, the LDAP Authentication provider uses the same DN and
    password used to connect to the LDAP server when following referrals
    during a search. If you want to connect as an anonymous user, enable
    this attribute.</p>

- name: PropagateCauseForLoginException
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether the providers should propagate the cause of the
    LoginException.</p>

- name: CacheEnabled
  helpHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether a cache is used with the LDAP server</p>

- name: CacheSize
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The size of the cache (in kilobytes) that is used with the LDAP
    server</p>

- name: EnableCacheStatistics
  helpSummaryHTML: >
    <p>Specifies whether to enable statistics of the cache if
    LDAP Server Cache and Group Membership Lookup Hierarchy Cache are enabled.</p>

- name: IdentityDomain
  helpHTML: >
    <p>The name of the identity domain.</p>

- name: StaticGroupDNsfromMemberDNFilter
  label: Static Group DNs From Member DN Filter
