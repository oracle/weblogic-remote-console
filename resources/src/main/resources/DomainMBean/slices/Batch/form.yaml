  <p>A batch runtime (per JSR 352) provides support for defining,
  implementing, and running batch jobs. Batch jobs are tasks that
  can be executed without user interaction and are best suited for
  non-interactive, bulk-oriented and long-running tasks that are resource
  intensive, can execute sequentially or parallel, and may be initiated
  ad hoc or through scheduling.</p><p>Use this page to define the Batch
  configuration of this WebLogic Server domain.</p>
