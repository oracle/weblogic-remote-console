introductionHTML: >
  <p>Use this page to create and configure an allowlist for this domain. </p>
  <p>WebLogic Server uses JEP 290 allowlists and blocklists to filter incoming serialized Java objects to protect
  against deserialization exploits. Allowlists are configuration files that define a list of the WebLogic Server
  and customer application classes and packages that you wish to allow to be deserialized. You can create and configure
  allowlists to control which packages and classes are deserialized (or blocked) in running systems.</p>
  <p>By default, WebLogic Server includes a JEP 290 blocklist filter that includes a set of prohibited classes
  and packages, and the ability to define dynamic blocklists using configuration files you can update or replace
  while the server is running. While both approaches have benefits, the allowlist model is more secure because
  it only allows deserialization of classes known to be required by WebLogic Server and customer applications.</p>
  <p>To create an allowlist that contains the classes and packages that are deserialized in the applications in your domain,
  you enable recording, which records all of the classes and packages used in both WebLogic Server and customer application deserialization.
  When deserialization occurs, each class is recorded in the allowlist configuration file.
  When you have executed all of the code paths that perform deserialization and are satisfied with the allow list,
  turn off recording and then configure WebLogic Server to use the allowlist configuration file for the JEP 290 filtering.</p>
