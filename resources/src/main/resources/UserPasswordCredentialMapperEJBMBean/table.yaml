  <p>Credential mapping for an EJB component is the process in which
  WebLogic Server users are mapped to database users. If credential
  mapping is enabled on the EJB component, when an application requests a
  database connection from the module, WebLogic Server determines the
  current WebLogic Server user and then sets the mapped database user as a
  lightweight client ID on the database connection.</p>
  <p>The following table lists the EJB components in this application that have
  one or more configured credential mappings.
