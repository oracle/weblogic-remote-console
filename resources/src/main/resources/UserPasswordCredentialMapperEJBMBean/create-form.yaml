  <p>Credential mapping for an EJB component is the process in which
  WebLogic Server users are mapped to database users. If credential
  mapping is enabled on the EJB component, when an application requests a
  database connection from the module, WebLogic Server determines the
  current WebLogic Server user and then sets the mapped database user as a
  lightweight client ID on the database connection.</p>
  <p>This page creates the first credential and credential mapping for an EJB component.</p>
  <p>If the application is currently running on one or more servers, the module
  and EJB names can be found by navigating to the "Deployments" -> "Application Runtimes"
  -> this application -> "Component Runtimes" in the monitoring tree.
  Select the component that contains the EJB. Use its "Module Id" as the module name.
  Select "EJB Runtimes" to find the EJB name.</p>
  <p>If the application is not currently running on any servers, look inside
  inside the deployment to get the module and EJB names.  For example,
  application.xml contains the module name.</p>
