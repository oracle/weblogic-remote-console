  <p>You can specify how WebLogic Server resolves an external entity within
  an XML file by creating an Entity Spec entry. The entry lists the Public
  ID and System ID of a particular external entity and where the referenced
  entity file is stored locally, relative to the Administration Server,
  or the URI of the file out on the Web. This page lists the Entity Spec
  entries associated with the current XML registry. Click on the Public
  ID to see configuration information for a particular entry.</p>
