  <p>Use this page to configure a counter monitor, which periodically polls
  an attribute whose value is an integer and compares the attribute value
  with a high threshold that you define. A counter monitor generates
  a notification if the attribute value equals or exceeds the high
  threshold. You can also configure an offset or modulus, which increases
  or decreases the threshold each time the threshold is crossed.</p>
