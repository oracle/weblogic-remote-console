     <p>If this monitor's SNMP agent is running on the Administration Server,
     use this page to select the servers that you want to monitor.</p>
     <p>If this monitor's SNMP agent is running only on individual Managed
     Servers, you do not need to select a server from this list. An SNMP agent
     on a Managed Server monitors only its host Managed Server. It ignores this
     list of servers.</p>
