  <p>Outbound credential mappings let you map WebLogic Server usernames to
  usernames in the Enterprise Information System (EIS) to which you want to
  connect using a resource adapter. You can use default outbound credential
  mappings for all outbound connection pools in the resource adapter, or
  specify particular outbound credential mappings for individual connection
  pools.</p>
  <p>This page creates the credential and credential mapping for a resource adapter.
  If the connection pool name is empty, then the new mapping is a default
  mapping all of the resource adapter's connection pools.</p>
  <p>If the application is currently running on one or more servers, the module,
  EIS type and connection pool name can be found in the monitoring tree.
  Navigate to 
  "Deployments" -> "Application Runtimes" -> this application -> "Component Runtimes" -> your connector.
  Use "EIS Resource Id"'s "module" field as the module and "eis" field as the EIS type.
  Then navigate to "Connection Pools" -> your connection pool and use "EIS Resource Id"'s
  "destinationId" field as the connection pool name.</p>
  <p>If the application is not currently running on any servers, look inside inside the deployment.
  For example, application.xml contains the module name, ra.yaml contains the EIS type and
  weblogic-ra.xml contains the connection pool name.</p>
