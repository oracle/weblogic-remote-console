    <p>Select this option to enable non-XA connections from the data source
    to participate in global transactions.</p>

  helpDetailsHTML: >
    <p>In most cases, if your application includes global transactions,
    you should use an XA JDBC driver to create database connections. You
    may need to enable this option for use with EJBs. If you enable support
    for global transactions with a non-XA JDBC driver, you must select an
    option for transaction processing.</p>
