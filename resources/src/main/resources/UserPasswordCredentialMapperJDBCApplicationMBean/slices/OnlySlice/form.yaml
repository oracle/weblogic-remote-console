introductionHTML: >
  <p>Credential mapping for a JDBC application is the process in which WebLogic
  Server user IDs are mapped to database user IDs. If credential mapping is
  enabled on the application, when an application requests a database connection
  from the data source, WebLogic Server determines the current WebLogic
  Server user ID and then sets the mapped database ID as a light-weight
  client ID on the database connection.</p>
  <p>This feature relies on features in the JDBC driver and DBMS. It is not
  supported for all drivers and database management systems.</p>
  <p>To determine whether this deployment is a JDBC application, look at
  the deployed file.  If it is a JDBC xml file, then this is a JDBC application.</p>
