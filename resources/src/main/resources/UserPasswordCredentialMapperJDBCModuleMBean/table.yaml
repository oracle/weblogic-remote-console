introductionHTML: >
  <p>Credential mapping for a JDBC module is the process in which WebLogic
  Server usersare mapped to database users. If credential mapping is
  enabled on the module, when an application requests a database connection
  from the data source, WebLogic Server determines the current WebLogic
  Server user and then sets the mapped database user as a light-weight
  client ID on the database connection.</p>
  <p>This feature relies on features in the JDBC driver and DBMS. It is not
  supported for all drivers and database management systems.</p>
  <p>The following table lists the JDBC modules in this application that have
  one or more configured credential mappings.
