  <p>Credential mapping for a JDBC module is the process in which WebLogic
  Server usersare mapped to database users. If credential mapping is
  enabled on the module, when an application requests a database connection
  from the data source, WebLogic Server determines the current WebLogic
  Server user and then sets the mapped database user as a light-weight
  client ID on the database connection.</p>
  <p>This feature relies on features in the JDBC driver and DBMS. It is not
  supported for all drivers and database management systems.</p>
  <p>This page creates the first credential and credential mapping for a JDBC module.</p>
  <p>If the application is currently running on one or more servers, the module
  and data source names can be found by navigating to the "Deployments" -> "Application Runtimes"
  -> this application -> "Component Runtimes" in the monitoring tree.
  Select the component corresponding to the JDBC module. Use its "Module Id" as
  the module name and its "Name" as the data source name.</p>
  <p>If the application is not currently running on any servers, look inside
  inside the deployment to get the module and data source names.  For example,
  weblogic-application.xml contains the module name and the name of the xml file
  containing the data source's configuration.  That xml file contains the name
  of the data source.</p>
