  p>This page allows you to define the messaging settings for this cluster.
      Clusters use messaging for sharing session, load balancing and failover,
      JMS, and other information between cluster members. Clusters can use
      either Unicast or Multicast messaging. Multicast is a simple broadcast
      technology that enables multiple applications to subscribe to a given IP
      address and port number and listen for messages, but requires hardware
      configuration and support. Unicast does not have these requirements.</p>
