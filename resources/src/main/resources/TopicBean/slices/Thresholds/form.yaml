introductionHTML: >
  <p>Use this page to define upper and lower byte and/or message thresholds
  for the topic. Exceeding these thresholds will trigger events such as
  generating log messages and starting message flow control. You can also
  specify a maximum size allowed for messages on the topic and select a
  pre-configured quota, which determines the maximum number of bytes or
  messages that the topic is allowed to store to conserve memory use.</p>
