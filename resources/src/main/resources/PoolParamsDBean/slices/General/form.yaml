  <p><b>Note</b>: If you have not explictly set a value on a connection instance
  (e.g. <code>Initial Capacity</code>), WebLogic will use the value from the instance's group.
  Similarly, if you have not set a value on a connection group, WebLogic will use the value from <code>ra.xml</code>.
  Use this deployment's <code>Deployment Plan</code> or <code>Variable Assignments</code> page
  to see which values have been set on the instances and groups.</p>
