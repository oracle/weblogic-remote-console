/**
 * A hook for observing and responding to changes to the size of a DOM element.
 * It utilizes a ResizeObserver to observe changes to the size of the specified element
 * and accepts a callback function to respond to these changes.
 *
 * @param ref The ref to the target DOM element to observe.
 *     Note that if the element is dynamically added or remounted (e.g., due to conditional rendering or changes in dynamic lists),
 *     a simple useRef object will not automatically trigger the hook to re-observe the new element.
 *     To handle such cases, ensure that the hook receives a new ref whenever the DOM element changes.
 *     One way to achieve this is by storing the ref in state and updating it using a callback ref.
 * @param callback A callback function to be called when the size of the observed element changes.
 *     If the provided callback triggers the consuming component to re-render, then
 *     it's important to pass the same instance of the callback function during each render
 *     to prevent infinite re-render loops. One way to achieve this is by using useCallback.
 * @param options Configuration options.
