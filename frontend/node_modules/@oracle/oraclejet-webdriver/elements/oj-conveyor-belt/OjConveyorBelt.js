 *  <h4>Migration</h4>
 *  When you migrate a page from using [oj-conveyor-belt](../../jsdocs/oj.ojConveyorBelt.html) to [oj-c-conveyor-belt](../../jsdocs/oj-c.ConveyorBelt.html) you will also need to migrate your WebDriver tests from OjConveyorBelt to ConveyorBeltWebElement. To do that you will need to revise type and locator instances as follows
 *  </br><b>Type:</b> from OjConveyorBelt to [ConveyorBeltWebElement](../../cpwdtsdoc/classes/ConveyorBeltWebElement.html)
 *  </br><b>Locator:</b> from [ojConveyorBelt](../functions/elements.ojConveyorBelt-1.html) to [findConveyorBelt](../../cpwdtsdoc/functions/findConveyorBelt.html)
 *  </br>For more details on migrating from legacy to core pack please see component's [migration section](../../jsdocs/oj.ojConveyorBelt.html#migration-section)
