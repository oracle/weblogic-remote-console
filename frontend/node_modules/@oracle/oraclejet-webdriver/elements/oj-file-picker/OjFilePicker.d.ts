 *  <h4>Migration</h4>
 *  When you migrate a page from using [oj-file-picker](../../jsdocs/oj.ojFilePicker.html) to [oj-c-file-picker](../../jsdocs/oj-c.FilePicker.html) you will also need to migrate your WebDriver tests from OjFilePicker to FilePickerWebElement. To do that you will need to revise type and locator instances as follows
 *  </br><b>Type:</b> from OjFilePicker to [FilePickerWebElement](../../cpwdtsdoc/classes/FilePickerWebElement.html)
 *  </br><b>Locator:</b> from [ojFilePicker](../functions/elements.ojFilePicker-1.html) to [findFilePicker](../../cpwdtsdoc/functions/findFilePicker.html)
 *  </br>For more details on migrating from legacy to core pack please see component's [migration section](../../jsdocs/oj.ojFilePicker.html#migration-section)
