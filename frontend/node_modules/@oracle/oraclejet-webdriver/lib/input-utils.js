 * Mixin a "changeValue" function to the given class to perform a value change
 * on the component.
 *
 * NOTE: The changeValue method will focus on the component's .oj-text-field-input
 * and call sendKeys to send the value through the component UI. To trigger the
 * value update and validation, this method also calls validate() on the component
 * directly.
 * We don't want to send Tab because that can cause other model updates in the
 * component is embedded within another container which is listening on blur to
 * update its values, such as oj-dynamic-form.
 * We also don't want to send Enter as that can cause containers listening on
 * key events to submit/navigate/etc when Enter is received on any of the fields,
 * such as a field in oj-dialog which closes the dialog when user presses Enter.
 *
 * @param clazz The class to be modified
 * @param inputLocator An optional Locator which identifies the input element to
 * be interacted with. This locator should be relative to the component root, and
 * should be able to receive focus in the DOM. If not specified, the root of the
 * component is assumed to be the focusable element.
