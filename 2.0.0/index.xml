      <description>This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the WebLogic Remote Console.
Can I connect the WebLogic Remote Console to domains running in WebLogic on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Yes, you can. First, make sure that the domain&amp;rsquo;s administration server is publicly accessible so the WebLogic Remote Console can establish a connection to the administration server. Then, in the WebLogic Remote Console, enter your credentials and the publicly accessible URL for the WebLogic Administration Server.</description>

      <description>The domain configuration process in the WebLogic Remote Console is similar to the Administration Console. When you start editing the domain, a configuration lock is placed on the domain that blocks other users from making simultaneous changes. Once you&amp;rsquo;re are satisfied with your changes, you can &amp;lsquo;activate&amp;rsquo; these changes and perpetuate them to the administration and management servers.
Configuration locks do not apply to WDT model files. As WDT model files are not connected to live domains, they do not require any locks to prevent conflicting changes.</description>

      <description>This page provides guidelines to help troubleshoot console issues.
Check log files for errors The WebLogic Remote Console provides log files for both front and back end processes. For instructions on how to access these log files, see Check Log Files.
Diagnose invalid WebLogic configuration issues Administration Server The WebLogic Remote Console catches most validation errors when you click Save, or when you commit the change using the shopping cart. If an error message displays, you need to identify and correct the problem that caused the error before you can activate the changes.</description>

      <title>Use an alternative logging configuration file</title>

      <description>By default, the WebLogic Remote Console uses the logging.properties file inside the runnable/console-backend-server-{version}.jar file.
If the default configuration is sufficient, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do anything. However, if you want to tweak the logger configuration without regenerating the runnable/console-backend-server-{version}.jar file, you can pass the -Djava.util.logging.config.file=&amp;lt;path-to-logging.properties&amp;gt; Java system property when starting the console.
For example:
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=runnable/etc/logging.properties If there is a problem using the specified path, then the logging.properties inside the runnable/console-backend-server-{version}.</description>
