      <description>This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the WebLogic Remote Console.
Can I connect the WebLogic Remote Console to domains running in WebLogic on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Yes, you can. First, make sure that the domain&amp;rsquo;s administration server is publicly accessible so the WebLogic Remote Console can establish a connection to the administration server. Then, in the WebLogic Remote Console, enter your credentials and the publicly accessible URL for the WebLogic Administration Server.</description>

      <description>The WebLogic Remote Console can connect directly to a WebLogic Administration Server to view and edit its domain, much like the WebLogic Server Administration Console, though there are some differences.
You can save the connection details for multiple WebLogic Administration Servers, making it easy to switch between domains with a click.
Connect to a WebLogic Administration Server  Start the WebLogic Administration Server. Expand the Kiosk and beside the project name, click ⋮.</description>

      <description>This page provides guidelines to help troubleshoot console issues.
Check log files for errors The WebLogic Remote Console provides log files for both front and back end processes. For instructions on how to access these log files, see Check Log Files.
Diagnose invalid WebLogic configuration issues Administration Server The WebLogic Remote Console catches most validation errors when you click Save, or when you commit the change using the shopping cart. If an error message displays, you need to identify and correct the problem that caused the error before you can activate the changes.</description>

      <title>Use an alternative logging configuration file</title>

      <guid>/weblogic-remote-console/develop/alternative-logging/</guid>
      <description>By default, the WebLogic Remote Console uses the logging.properties file inside the runnable/console-backend-server-{version}.jar file.
If the default configuration is sufficient, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do anything. However, if you want to tweak the logger configuration without regenerating the runnable/console-backend-server-{version}.jar file, you can pass the -Djava.util.logging.config.file=&amp;lt;path-to-logging.properties&amp;gt; Java system property when starting the console.
For example:
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=runnable/etc/logging.properties If there is a problem using the specified path, then the logging.properties inside the runnable/console-backend-server-{version}.</description>

      <description>WebLogic Server regularly checks domains to ensure they comply with its recommended security policies. If a domain does not meet the recommendations, a security warning is logged and displayed in the WebLogic Remote Console.
You must have the July 2021 Patch Set Update (PSU) for WebLogic Server applied to your domain to receive security warnings.
 When there are active security warnings in your domain, a banner with red text appears at the top of the WebLogic Remote Console window.</description>

      <description>WDT metadata models are descriptions of a WebLogic Server domain configuration, generally written in YAML but occasionally JSON. These models are not connected to a live domain and you edit them &amp;lsquo;offline&amp;rsquo; before using the WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) to build or modify live domains from the models.
See the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation for more information.
We recommend that you use the desktop application over the browser application when working with WDT model files.</description>

      <description>The WebLogic Remote Console is distinct from the WebLogic Server Administration Console that is deployed as part of your WebLogic domain. As you explore the WebLogic Remote Console, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice key differences between the two consoles:
 The user interface has been completely redesigned to conform to the Oracle Redwood theme included with Oracle JET. The configuration and monitoring runtime content is separated into separate pages in the Remote Console. In the WebLogic Server Administration Console, the configuration and runtime information is presented on one page.</description>

      <description>The WebLogic Remote Console restricts what non-administrator users can see or do. Users with the roles Deployer, Monitor, or Operator are only shown the areas and features necessary for their role. These restrictions range from broad (hiding the entire Edit Tree perspective from users in the Monitor role) to narrow (hiding Create buttons on some pages). For full access to all the functionality of the WebLogic Remote Console, log in as an administrator.</description>
