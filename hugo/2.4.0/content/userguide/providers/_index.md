# Provider types

The WebLogic Remote Console lets you manage a variety of WebLogic Server configuration tools, called providers. Each provider type offers a different approach for configuring your WebLogic Server domains.

| Provider Type | Description |
|---|---|
|[Administration Server]({{< relref "userguide/providers/administration-server" >}})| Add connections to WebLogic Administration Servers and edit domain configurations in real-time. An alternative to the WebLogic Administration Console. |
|[Property List]({{< relref "userguide/providers/administration-server" >}})| Create and edit lists of key-value pairs. You can connect property lists to WDT model files as WDT variables to simplify the use of WDT model tokens.|
|[WDT Model File]({{< relref "userguide/providers/wdt-model" >}})| Create and edit abstract representations of WebLogic Server domains that you can use to quickly build live domains. |
|[WDT Composite Model File]({{< relref "userguide/providers/wdt-composite" >}})| View the combined details of multiple WDT model files at once. |
