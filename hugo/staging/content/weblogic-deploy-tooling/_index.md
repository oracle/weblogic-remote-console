WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) lets you easily create and manage WebLogic Server environments. In WDT, a WebLogic domain and its properties are expressed as a YAML set, which creates a metadata model that describes the domain it will create or the changes it will implement.

These WDT metadata models establish a process that is easy to manipulate, verify, and repeat. For more information on WDT, see [WebLogic Deploy Tooling]( https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-deploy-tooling/).

WebLogic Remote Console lets you create WDT model files within its console. Although you cannot deploy or build a live domain from within WebLogic Remote Console, the inclusion of WDT within WebLogic Remote Console provides a familiar and graphical interface for the various WebLogic properties, which you can use to map to their equivalent YAML keys.
