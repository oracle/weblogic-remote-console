descriptionHTML: '<p>A uniform distributed destination is a distributed destination
  whose members are configured as part of its configuration; since members share the
  same configuration, they are uniform.  There is one member on each JMS Server that
  conforms to the targeting criteria of the uniform distributed destination. For example,
  if a uniform distributed destination is targeted to a cluster, then one member will
  be created on each JMS server in the cluster.  Members are created and destroyed
  as the targeting is changed.</p> '
