  descriptionHTML: '<p> The uniform distributed topic message Forwarding Policy specifies
    whether a sent message is forwarded to all members. </p>  <p>The valid values
    are:</p> <ul> <li><b>Replicated</b> - The default. All physical topic members
    receive each sent message. If a message arrives at one of the physical topic members,
    a copy of this message is forwarded to the other members of that uniform distributed
    topic. A subscription on any one particular member will get a copy of any message
    sent to the uniform distributed topic logical name or to any particular uniform
    distributed topic member.</li>  <li><b>Partitioned</b> - The physical member receiving
    the message is the only member of the uniform distributed topic that is aware
    of the message. When a message is published to the logical name of a Partitioned
    uniform distributed topic, it will only arrive on one particular physical topic
    member. Once a message arrives on a physical topic member, the message is not
    forwarded to the rest of the members of the uniform distributed destination, and
    subscribers on other physical topic members do not get a copy of that message.
    The Partitioned capability was added in WebLogic 10.3.4 (11gR1PS3).</li> </ul>
    <p>A publisher that uses a logical JNDI name of a Replicated distributed topic
    is created on one member and every send call  publishes messages to the same member
    regardless the value of the <code>Load Balancing Enabled</code> attribute. This
    is behavior is backward compatible with previous WebLogic Server releases when
    using a uniform distributed topic. Under the same conditions, a Partitioned distributed
    topic publishes to the same member only when the value of the <code>Load Balancing
    Enabled</code> attribute is set to false. If the value of the <code>Load Balancing
    Enabled</code> attribute is to true, a publisher to a Partitioned distributed
    topic publishes messages that are load balanced accross all the members of the
    uniform distributed topic. </p>  <p>Most new applications will use the new Partitioned
    forwarding policy in combination with a logical subscription topology on a uniform
    distributed topic that consists of: (1) a same named physical subscription created
    directly on each physical member, (2) a Client ID Policy of Unrestricted, and
    (3) a Subscription Sharing Policy of <code>Sharable</code>. WL 10.3.4 Message
    Driven Beans (MDBs) provides a Topic Messages Distribution Mode option to automatically
    setup this kind of topology.</p>  <p> Note: This attribute is ignored by standalone/singleton
    Topics, it only applies to distributed topics. </p> '
