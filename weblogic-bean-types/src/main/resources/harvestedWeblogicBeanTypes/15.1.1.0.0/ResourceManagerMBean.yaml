descriptionHTML: '<p> A <code>ResourceManagerMBean</code> represents a resource consumption
  management policy. A policy controls and governs the use of shared resources in
  a Server runtime, by a Partition that the policy is attached to. A resource manager
  holds information on constraints and recourse actions for different resources in
  a Server instance. </p> <p> A system administrator defines a resource manager and
  configures child MBeans that represent particular combinations of shares and usage
  limits of various resources in the Server runtime. </p> <p> The system administrator
  may then assign the resource manager to one or more Partitions to ensure fair allocation
  of shared resources to collocated Domain Partitions, and to ensure that one Partition
  doesn''t exhaust shared resources (potentially affecting other collocated Partitions).
  </p> <p> The set of resources on which resource management policies can be assigned
  to, and the child MBeans through which they can be configured are: </p> <ol> <li>File
  Open: FileOpenMBean</li> <li>Heap Retained: HeapRetainedMBean</li> <li>CPU Utilization:
  CpuUtilizationMBean</li> </ol> '
