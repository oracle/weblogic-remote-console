  descriptionHTML: 'The security protocol used by an RMI client to access a data source.
    Values are: <ul> <li>Secure: All incoming application JDBC calls over RMI by remote
    clients and servers are rejected. Internal inter-server JDBC over RMI operations
    are allowed for the LoggingLastResource, EmulateTwoPhaseCommit and OnePhaseCommit
    Global Transactions Protocol options.  This option requires that all servers have
    a SSL listen port configured.  If not, all operations fail with an exception.</li>
    <li>Compatibility: Use an insecure channel with the application''s subject and
    no check for inbound administrator authentication when using RMI to access a data
    source. This setting reflects the legacy implementation behavior for RMI access
    to a data source and is a potential security vulnerability as it provides a client
    uncontrolled access to a database.</li> <li>Disabled: All JDBC over RMI traffic
    is rejected.  Internal inter-server JDBC over RMI operations for the LoggingLastResource,
    EmulateTwoPhaseCommit and OnePhaseCommit Global Transactions Protocol options
    will also fail.</li> <li>The default value is "Secure" for new domains.</li> </ul> '
