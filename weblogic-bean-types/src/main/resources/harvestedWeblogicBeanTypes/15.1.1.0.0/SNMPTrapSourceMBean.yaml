  descriptionHTML: '<p>This attribute is applicable only when the SNMP Agent is running
    on the Admin Server of a WebLogic Domain. The EnabledServers attribute allows
    the users to limit the scope of the monitored data sources to the specific named
    Servers. The EnabledServers list is ignored when the SNMAgentDeploymentMBean is
    targeted to a Managed Server. In the case of a Managed Server the SNMP Agent only
    looks at the data available in the WebLogic Server where the SNMP Agent is deployed.
    </p>  <p> For traps based on MBean attributes the SNMP Agent refers to the Domain
    Runtime MBean Server when it is running on the Admin Server and the Runtime MBean
    Server when it is deployed to a Managed Server. </p>  <p> In the case of <code>SNMPJMXMonitorMBean</code>
    and <code>SNMPAttributeChangeMBean</code> the <code>MonitoredMBeanType</code>
    and <code>MonitoredMBeanName</code> attributes specify the type and name of a
    WebLogic Server MBean for which the trap will be setup. MBeans that meet the Type
    and Name criteria are qualified to set the trap on. The EnabledServers attribute
    allows a user to specify additional criteria based on the Location of an MBean
    when the SNMP Agent is targeted to the Admin Server. MBeans whose Location matches
    one of the Servers in the EnabledServers list are considered eligible for the
    trap to be generated for a corresponding JMX notification. When the EnabledServers
    attribute is not specified all MBeans whose Type and Name match are considered
    as valid sources for the SNMP trap. </p>  <p> In the case of <code>SNMPLogFilterMBean</code>
    the EnabledServers attribute allows a user to specify the Servers in the Domain
    whose log messages will be monitored when the Agent is running on the Admin Server.
    When EnabledServers is not specified for an Agent running on the Admin Server
    log messages on all Managed Servers in the domain are monitored for sending traps.
    This attribute is not applicable when the SNMP Agent is targeted to a Managed
    Server, in this case the traps are sent based on log messages generated by the
    respective Managed Server where the Agent is deployed. </p> '
