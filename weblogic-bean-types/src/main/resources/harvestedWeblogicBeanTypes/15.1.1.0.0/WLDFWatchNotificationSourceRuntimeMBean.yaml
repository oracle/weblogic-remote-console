- weblogic.management.runtime.RuntimeMBean
descriptionHTML: '<p>Attaches an action listener in order to receive action events
  when a policy evaluates to <code>true</code>. Note that the listener will receive
  all actions; the caller must filter the output.</p>  <p>Unlike the deprecated WLDFWatchJMXNotificationRuntimeMBean,
  the action generated by this source is a Java Map object comprised of simple JDK
  types, and does not require a client dependency on any WLDF code.</p>  <p>Note:
  As of WebLogic Server 12.2.1, the terms <i>watch</i> and <i>notification</i> are
  replaced by <i>policy</i> and <i>action</i>, respectively. However, the definition
  of these terms has not changed.</p> '
