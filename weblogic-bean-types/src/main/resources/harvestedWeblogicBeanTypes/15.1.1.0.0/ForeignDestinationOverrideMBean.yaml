descriptionHTML: 'For each configuration entity that supports per-partition-override
  via a MBean, we have two MBeans, the original configure MBean and the corresponding
  override MBean, that eventually determine the effective settings of the configured
  resource.  We mark an attribute of an override MBean "dynamic true" even though
  the original configure MBean masks it "dynamic false". This is to make sure that
  the overriding settings take effect on partition restart. Otherwise a server restart
  is required.  <p>Defines partition-specific overrides for the most commonly overridden
  attributes in a ForeignDestination MBean. It overrides some of the settings in a
  same-named ForeignDestination MBean instance in the same multi-tenant scope to which
  this override MBean belongs. </p> '
