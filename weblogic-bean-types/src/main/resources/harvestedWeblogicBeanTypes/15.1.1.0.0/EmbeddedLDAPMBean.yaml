    is a potential security risk because the String object (which contains the unencrypted
    password) remains in the JVM''s memory until garbage collection removes it and
    the memory is reallocated. Depending on how memory is allocated in the JVM, a
    significant amount of time could pass before this unencrypted data is removed
    from memory.</p>  <p>Instead of using this attribute, use <code>CredentialEncrypted()</code>.</p> '
