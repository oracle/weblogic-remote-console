    to or lower than the security level that is configured for communication between
    the WebLogic SNMP agent and SNMP managers. For example, if the WebLogic SNMP agent
    requires incoming SNMPv3 requests to use the authentication protocol but no privacy
    protocol, the security level for this proxy must be either Authentication Only
    or None.  Note that if you want to use the authorization  or privacy protocols,
    you must configure credential mapping in the WebLogic Server security realm.</p>  <p>The
    WebLogic SNMP agent cannot forward or pass through the credentials that are contained
    in SNMPv3 requests from SNMP managers. Instead, the agent authenticates and performs
    other security operations on incoming requests, and then constructs a new request
