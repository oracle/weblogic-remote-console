  descriptionHTML: '<p>Defines the type of migration policy to use for the services
    hosted by this migratable target. Valid options are:</p> <ul> <li><code>Manual
    Service Migration Only</code> Indicates that no automatic migration of services
    hosted by this migratable target will occur.</li> <li><code>Auto-Migrate Failure-Recovery
    Services</code> Indicates that the services hosted by this migratable target will
    only start if the migratable target''s User Preferred Server (UPS) is started.
    If an administrator manually shuts down the UPS, either gracefully or forcibly,
    then a failure-recovery service will not migrate. However, if the UPS fails due
    to an internal error, then the service will be migrated to another candidate server.
    If such a candidate server is unavailable (due to either a manual shutdown or
    an internal failure), then the migration framework will first attempt to reactivate
    the service on its UPS server. If the UPS server is not available at that time,
    then the service will be migrated to another candidate server.</li> <li><code>Auto-Migrate
    Shutdown-Recovery Services</code> Indicates that the services hosted by this migratable
    target will migrate to one of the candidate servers, if server is administratively
    shut down (either gracefully or forcibly). Once recovery is done, service is migrated
    back to failed server.</li> </ul> '
