descriptionHTML: 'MBean for RMI forwarding configuration.  RMI forwarding is a feature
  that makes cross-domain transactions involving domains managed by the WebLogic Kubernetes
  Operator possible without requiring each server in a cluster to be individually
  addressable, where transaction server participants are not able to establish connection
  directly with one another.  RMI messages destined for a WebLogic server on a host
  with host name that begins with the name of this MBean will be sent to the configured
  URL. The messages are then forwarded to a WebLogic server in the destination domain,
  and eventually to the destination WebLogic server. '
