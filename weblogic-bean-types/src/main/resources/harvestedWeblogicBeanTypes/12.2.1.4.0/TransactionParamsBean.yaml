  descriptionHTML: '<p>Indicates whether a XA queue or XA topic connection factory
    is returned, instead of a queue or topic connection factory. An XA connection
    factory can be used to create an <code>XAConnection</code>, which in turn may
    be used to create an <code>XASession</code>, which in turn may be used to obtain
    an <code>XAResource</code> for use inside a transaction manager. </p>  <p>In addition,
    this attribute indicates whether or not a connection factory creates sessions
    that are JTA aware. If true, the associated message producers and message consumers
    look into the running thread for a transaction context. Otherwise, the current
    JTA transaction will be ignored. </p>  <p><i>Note:</i> Transacted sessions ignore
    the current threads transaction context in favor of their own internal transaction,
    regardless of the setting. This setting only affects non-transacted sessions.
