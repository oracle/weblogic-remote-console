descriptionHTML: '<p>This bean represents a machine on which servers may be booted.
  A server is bound to a machine by calling to <code>ServerMBean.setMachine()</code>.
  Although it is typical that one <code>MachineMBean</code> refers to one physical
  machine and vice versa, it is possible to have a multihomed machine represented
  by multiple <code>MachineMBeans</code>. The only restriction is that each <code>MachineMBean</code>
  be configured with non-overlapping addresses. A configuration may contain one or
  more of <code>MachineMBeans</code> which may be looked up by their logical names.</p> '
