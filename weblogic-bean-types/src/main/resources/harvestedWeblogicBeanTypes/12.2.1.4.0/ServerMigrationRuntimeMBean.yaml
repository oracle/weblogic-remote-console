descriptionHTML: 'ServerMigrationRuntimeMBean provides runtime monitoring information
  about the past migrations performed by this server as the cluster master. If this
  server was never the cluster master then no information would be available. This
  RuntimeMBean would be hosted on all cluster members and can be queried for the location
  of the cluster master which is just another peer in the cluster. JMX clients can
  make another call to the server hosting the cluster master functionality to get
  the migration history. <p> Please note that the migration history is not persisted
  and is lost when a server is shutdown. </p> '
