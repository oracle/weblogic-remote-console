  descriptionHTML: '<p>Controls the flag that is used to initialize COM in native
    mode.</p>  <p>By default, when jCOM initializes COM in native mode, it starts
    COM with the <code>COINIT_MULTITHREADED</code>. This causes COM to use Multi-Threaded
    Apartment (MTA) thread model. In the MTA model, calls to an object are not synchronized
    by COM. Multiple clients can concurrently call an object that supports this model
    on different threads, and the object must provide synchronization in its interface/method
    implementations using synchronization objects such as events, mutexes, semaphores,
    etc. MTA objects can receive concurrent calls from multiple out-of-process clients
    through a pool of COM-created threads belonging to the object''s process.</p>  <p>If
    the server logs a Class Not Registered Message when starting COM in native mode,
    try setting this property. This will cause jCOM to start COM in native mode, using
    <code>COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED</code> option instead of the <code>COINIT_MULTITHREADED</code>
    option. In a component that is marked as Apartment Threaded, each method of that
    component will execute on a thread that is associated with that component. This
    separates the methods into their own "Apartments", with each instance of a component
    corresponding to one apartment. While there is only one thread inside of a component,
    each instance of that component will have its own thread apartment.</p> '

    in a <code>java.lang.Enumeration</code> (that had been improperly converted from
    a COM <code>VariantEnumeration</code> type) so the correct value is returned when
    the <code>hasMoreElements()</code> method is called.</p>  <p>Some COM methods
    return a COM VariantEnumeration type. The java2com tool automatically converts
    the returned type into a java.lang.Enumeration. This is not a perfect match since
    COM enumerations have no equivalent to the <code>hasMoreElements()</code> call.
    The client must continue to call <code>nextElement</code> until a <code>NoSuchElementException</code>
    occurs. Setting this property will cause jCOM to prefetch the next element in
    behind the scenes and return the correct value when hasMoreElements is called.</p> '
