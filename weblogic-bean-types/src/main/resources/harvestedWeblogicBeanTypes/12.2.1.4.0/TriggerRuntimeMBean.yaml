descriptionHTML: '<p> The <code>TriggerRuntimeMBean</code> holds runtime state (for
  the current Server instance) for a Trigger that has been configured in the Resource
  Consumption Management policy of the current Domain Partition. </p> <p> The WebLogic
  Resource Consumption Management feature automatically initiates the configured recourse
  action of a Trigger when the Trigger''s configured usage limits are exceeded by
  a Domain Partition. When a usage limit is exceeded, and the configured recourse
  action has been successfully executed, the Trigger is <i>Activated</i>. </p> <p>
  When the current resource usage by the Domain Partition falls below the Trigger''s
  configured usage limit, the feature automatically withdraws the recourse action
  where possible. When the current usage is below the configured usage limit, and
  the configured recourse action has been successfully withdrawn, the Trigger is said
  to be <i>not Activated</i>. </p> <p> The MBean captures the following states for
  a Trigger when the current resource consumption usage by the Domain Partition exceeds
  or goes below the configured usage limit for the Domain Partition: </p> <ul> <li>Whether
  the Trigger is <i>Activated</i> (usage has exceeded the limit and the recourse action
  was successfully executed) or not</li> <li>The time when the last recourse action
  was executed successfully for the Trigger</li> <li>Whether a recourse action has
  been initiated in response to the resource usage by the Domain Partition exceeding
  the configured usage limits</li> </ul> '
