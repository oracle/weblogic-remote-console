descriptionHTML: '<p>This bean is used to configure the attributes necessary to start
  up a server on a remote machine.</p>  <p>The following describes how NodeManager
  applies each property when starting the Coherence server.</p>  <p>#getJavaVendor</p>
  <p>The NodeManager does not pass this value invoking a java command line to start
  the server.  It does pass this value in the environment variable JAVA_VENDOR to
  the start script. </p>  <p>#getJavaHome</p> <p>This value can also be specified
  conveniently in the nodemanager .properties file using the coherence.startup.JavaHome
  or property. The NodeManager will pass this value to a start script using the JAVA_HOME
  environment variable.  When issuing a java command line to start the server, the
  NodeManager will use the java executable from the specified location. </p>   <p>#getClassPath</p>
  <p>The NodeManager will pass this value to a start script using the JAVA_OPTIONS
  environment variable containing -Djava.class.path.  When issuinga java command line
  to start the server, the NodeManager will pass -Djava.class.path.</p>  <p>#getMWHome</p>
  <p>This value can also be specified conveniently in the nodemanager .properties
  file using the coherence.startup.MWHome property. The NodeManager does not pass
  this value directly when starting a server.  However, it uses this value to construct
  an appropriate classpath for starting the server.</p>  <p>#getArguments</p> <p>This
  value can also be specified conveniently in the nodemanager .properties file using
  the coherence.startup.Arguments property. The NodeManager will pass this value to
  a start script using the JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable.  When issuing a java
  command line to start the server, the NodeManager will pass the arguments as options.
