descriptionHTML: '<p>Provides methods that transition resource groups from one state
  to another. This class is instantiated once for each resource group but only on
  the Administration Server. Even so, you can use a resource group''s instance to
  change the state of the resource group on Managed Servers as well as on the Administration
  Server.</p>  <p id="useTaskObject"><b>Detecting when Operations Complete</b></p>
  <p>Methods representing operations on resource groups return a ResourceGroupLifeCycleTaskRuntimeMBean
  object. The caller should monitor the returned instance, invoking its ResourceGroupLifeCycleTaskRuntimeMBean.isRunning()
  method to detect when the operation has completed. In particular, the caller should
  <b>not</b> rely on the value returned from getState() to indicate when an operation
  on a resource group that is targeted to multiple servers has finished. That value
  will be accurate as described in detail on getState() but can change before the
  operation has finished.</p>  <p id="desired"><b>Desired States</b></p> <p>The system
  tracks the <b>desired</b> state for each resource group, which defaults to the state
  <code>RUNNING</code>. Whenever a lifecycle operation method is called the system
  not only performs the requested action on the resource group but also records the
  resulting state as the new desired state for the resource group.</p> <p>The system
  uses the desired state for a resource group to bring the resource group to the correct
  state during server and partition start-up. The desired can also be used when the
  getState() method computes the overall state for the resource group.</p> '

    example, to <code>RUNNING</code>) as soon as the operation (such as start) has
    finished on one server, even while the operation is still in progress elsewhere.</p>
