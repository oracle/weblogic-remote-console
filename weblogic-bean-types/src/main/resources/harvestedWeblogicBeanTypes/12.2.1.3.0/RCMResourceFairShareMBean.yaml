descriptionHTML: '<p> The <code>RCMResourceFairShareMBean</code> is used to configure
  the Fair Share policy for a resource type. </p> <p> A Fair share policy is typically
  used to ensure that a fixed-size shared resource is shared effectively (yet fairly)
  by competing consumers. A Fair share policy may also be employed by a system administrator
  when a clear understanding of the exact usage of a resource by a Partition cannot
  be accurately determined in advance, and the system administrator would like efficient
  utilization of resources while ensuring fair allocation of shared resources to co-resident
  Partitions. </p> <p> A RCM fair-share policy provides the following assurance to
  the system administrator (in line with work manager''s definition of fair-share):
  When there is "contention" for a resource, and there is "uniform load" across multiple
  Partitions "over a period of time", the share of the resource allocated to these
  Partitions is "roughly" in ratio of their configured fair shares. </p> <p> A system
  administrator allocates a ''share'' to a Partition by specifying an integer value
  to let the fair share policy know the share of resources that must be allocated
  to the Partition during contention over time. The sum of all Partition shares need
  not equal 100. </p> '
