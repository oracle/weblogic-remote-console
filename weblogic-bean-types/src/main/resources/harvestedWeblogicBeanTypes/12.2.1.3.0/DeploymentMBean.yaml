descriptionHTML: 'A Deployment is any MBean that may be deployed on one or more targets,
  such as a Component, a Web Server personality, a JMS Front-end or back-end or a
  JDBC connection pool.  A deployment has targets, which specify which servers the
  deployment should be deployed on. Assigning the targets on a deployment will cause
  the deployment to get deployed on those targets. If the targets overlap, the deployment
  will only be deployed once. For example, if a deployment is deployed both on a cluster
  C and on a server S that is a member of that cluster, the deployment will be deployed
  on S only once.  Simply adding or removing a target will not affect the deployment
  state for this deployment. The user must explicitly activate or deactivate the deployment.  Certain
  types of deployments, ComponentMBeans, behave slightly differently. Please refer
  to their documentation for more information. '
