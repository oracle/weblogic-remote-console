  descriptionHTML: '<p>The name of the file that stores datasource profile records.
    Usually it is a computed value based on the name of the parent of this MBean.
    For example, for a datasource profile log, it is <code><i>serverName</i>.log</code>.</p>  <p>However,
    if the name of the parent cannot be obtained, the file name is <code>weblogic.log</code>.
    If you specify a relative pathname, it is interpreted as relative to the server''s
    root directory.</p>  <p>To include a time and date stamp in the file name when
    the log file is rotated, add <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code> variables
    to the file name. Surround each variable with percentage (<code>%</code>) characters.</p>  <p>For
    example, if the file name is defined to be <code>myjmsserver_%yyyy%_%MM%_%dd%_%hh%_%mm%.log</code>,
    the log file will be named <code>myserver_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm.log</code>.</p>  <p>When
    the log file is rotated, the rotated file name contains the date stamp. For example,
    if the log file is rotated on 2 April, 2005 at 10:05 AM, the log file that contains
    the old messages will be named <code>myserver_2005_04_02_10_05.log</code>.</p>  <p>If
    you do not include a time and date stamp, the rotated log files are numbered in
    order of creation. For example, <code>myjmsserver.log00007</code>.</p> '
