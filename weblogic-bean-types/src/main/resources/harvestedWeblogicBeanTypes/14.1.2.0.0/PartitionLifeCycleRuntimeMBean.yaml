descriptionHTML: '<p>Provides methods that transition partitions from one state to
  another. This class is instantiated once for each partition but only on the Administration
  Server. Even so, you can use a partition''s instance to change the state of the
  partition on Managed Servers as well as on the Administration Server.</p>  <p id="useTaskObject"><b>Detecting
  when Operations Complete</b></p>  <p>Methods representing operations on partitions
  return a PartitionLifeCycleTaskRuntimeMBean object. The caller should monitor the
  returned instance, invoking its PartitionLifeCycleTaskRuntimeMBean.isRunning() method
  to detect when the operation has completed. In particular, the caller should <b>not</b>
  rely on the value returned from getState() to indicate when an operation on a partition
  that is targeted to multiple servers has finished. That value will be accurate as
  described in detail on getState() but can change before the operation has finished.</p>  <p
  id="desired"><b>Desired States</b></p> <p>The system tracks the <b>desired</b> state
  for each partition, which defaults to the state <code>SHUTDOWN</code> and substate
  <code>HALTED</code>. Whenever a lifecycle operation method is called the system
  not only performs the requested action on the partition but also records the resulting
  state as the new desired state for the partition.</p> <p>The system uses the desired
  state for a partition to bring the partition to the correct state during server
  restart. It can also be used when the getState() method computes the overall state
  for the partition.</p> '
