  descriptionHTML: 'The version(s) which the attached bundle must match.  If this
    attribute is set then the bundleSymbolicName must also be set.  The format of
    the string is a version range, where the inclusive element of the range is denoted
    by ''['' or '']''.  The exclusive element of the range is denoted by ''('' or
    '')''.  A range is denoted by two versions, separated by a comma.  * may be used
    as the upper range, to indicate infinite upper range.  If the version is not a
    comma separated item then it must be a single version that is the only version
    that should match. <p> Examples include: <p> [1.0,2.0) : This would indicate any
    bundle between version 1 inclusive and 2 exclusive <p> 2.3.7.beta-1 : This would
    indicate an exact bundle version to attach to <p> (3.7,*) : This would indicate
    a lower version higher than 3.7 and no upper version limit <p> The versions themselves
    must conform to the OSGi standard for ranges, implying that the first three elements
    of the version must be numbers, while the last element of the version can be any
    string at all. '
