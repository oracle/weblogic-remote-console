descriptionHTML: 'CapacityMBean defines the maximum number of requests that can be
  enqueued by all the work managers that share it. <p> The server starts rejecting
  requests once the capacity threshold is reached. Note that the capacity includes
  all requests, queued or executing, from the constrained work set. This constraint
  is independent of the global queue threshold specified by OverloadProtectionMBean.getSharedCapacityForWorkManagers().
  </p> <p> Requests are rejected by performing overload actions. RMI work is rejected
  by sending back a recoverable exception to the clients. Servlet requests are rejected
  by sending back a 503 response. </p> '
