descriptionHTML: '<p>Exposes monitoring information about an ongoing and potentially
  long-running administrative process.  This should be taken to mean, at minimum,
  any OA&amp;M operation involving I/O.  Examples include starting and stopping servers,
  deploying and undeploying applications, or migrating services.</p>  <p>An MBean
  operation of this sort should fork a separate thread to perform the actual work
  and immediately return an instance of <code>TaskRuntimeMBean</code> to the caller.  The
  caller can then use this to track the task''s progress as desired.  Users can also
  query for all instances of <code>TaskRuntimeMBean</code> to get a summary of both
  currently-running and recently-completed tasks.</p>  <p>Instance of <code>TaskRuntimeMBean</code>
  continue to exist in the MBeanServer after the completion of the work they describe.  They
  will eventually either be explicitly deregistered by the user, or removed by a scavenger
  process which periodically purges instances of <code>TaskRuntimeMBean</code> that
  have been completed for some time.</p> '
