descriptionHTML: 'This class represents the reliable messaging delivery policy for
  the current WebLogic Server as both a sender and a receiver of a reliable SOAP message
  to and from a Web service running on a different WebLogic Server. <p> Reliable messaging
  is a framework for applications running in WebLogic Server to asynchronously and
  reliably invoke a Web service running in a different WebLogic Server.  Reliable
  messaging works only between WebLogic Servers.  This class encapsulates the default
  reliable messaging parameters for an application running in this WebLogic Server
  instance that both sends and receives a SOAP message reliably. These parameters
  include the number of times to retry sending the message, the time to wait between
  retries, the persistent store for the reliable message, and so on. </p> '
