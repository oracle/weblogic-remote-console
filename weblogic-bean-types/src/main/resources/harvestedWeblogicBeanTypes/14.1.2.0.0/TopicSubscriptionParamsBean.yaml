    the specified limit, then the first-most available messages on these subscriptions
    will be deleted to make room for the new message. Subscription messages are immune
    from this deletion if they''re participating in a pending transaction, have already
    been passed to a consumer and are awaiting acknowledgement, or if they are part
    of a Unit-of-Work that is still waiting to accumulate all of its messages. Note
    that if all messages are immune from deletion, then a new message can cause a
    subscription size to exceed its limit.</p>  <p>A value of -1 means no limit override.</p> '
