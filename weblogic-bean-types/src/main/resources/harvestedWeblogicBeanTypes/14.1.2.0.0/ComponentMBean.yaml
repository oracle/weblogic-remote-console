descriptionHTML: 'A component is a specific type of deployment that is part of a J2EE
  application (see ApplicationMBean). Typically it is a JAR, WAR, or RAR file that
  contains application code.  Deploying an application is primarily the sum of its
  component deployments. Components define the target servers for the application.
  A target may be a server or cluster. Web Applications may also reference Virtual
  hosts, which in turn define additional server/cluster targets. '
