  descriptionHTML: '<p> NodeManager timeout. Amount of time to wait for a response
    from NodeManager. NodeManager is used to get server state and decide if a server
    is really dead. Note that the server automatically calculates a timeout value
    and this mbean attribute is used as a upper bound. </p> <p> The NodeManager timeout
    is dependent on the type of the NodeManager used. For SSH nodemanager, the timeout
    is on the larger side due to the nature of the SSH connection establishment. The
    default timeout value might appear very large for some installations. Please set
    the timeout to a value that is representative of SSH performance in your environment.
    </p> <p> Note that if the NodeManager does not respond back within the timeout
    period, the machine is considered ''dead''. One retry attempt is provided by the
    server if the NodeManager timesout. On timeout, the server will wait for a FenceTimeout
    period and retry connecting to the NodeManager. If that call times out as well,
    the machine is deemed unavailable and taken out of the cluster view. </p> <p>
    A value of 0 means that the timeout will not be applied at all. </p> '

    right partition by periodically checking with all NodeManagers. This is used to
    cover a case where the cluster leader was elected with most of the servers shutdown
    but subsequently there is a network partition with the leader in the minority
    partition. This is just done on the cluster leader instance and not on other instances.</p> '
