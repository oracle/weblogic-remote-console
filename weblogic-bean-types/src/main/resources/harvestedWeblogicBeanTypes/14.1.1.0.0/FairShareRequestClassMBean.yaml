descriptionHTML: 'This mbean defines the fair share value to use for this request
  class. One of the components of work managers is a request class that indicates
  the proportional of the total server thread use time this request class gets. The
  default fair share value is 50. <p> Fair shares are reflected in scheduling logic
  such that as long as multiple fair shares compete, the average number of threads
  used by each is in proportion to their fair share. For example, consider we only
  have two fair shares, A and B, having a fair share of 80 and 20, respectively. During
  a period in which both fair shares are sufficiently requested, say, zero think time
  and more clients than threads, the probability that a thread will work on behalf
  of A or B will tend toward 80% or 20%, respectively. The scheduling logic ensures
  this even when A tends to use a thread for much longer than B. </p> <p> Fair share
  values can range from 1 to 1000. The default fair share value is 50. </p> '
