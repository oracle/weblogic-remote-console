descriptionHTML: '<p>The MBean interface must be implemented by any role mapping,
  authorization, credential mapping and audit providers MBean which should be aware
  of identity domain.</p>  <p>Certain WebLogic Security SPI (SSPI) providers must
  be identity-domain-aware to function correctly in a partitioned environment -- or,
  more precisely, in an environment where identity domains are configured into the
  system. For example, an authorization provider that doesn''t understand identity
  domains cannot correctly distinguish between two users with the same name but different
  identity domains, and therefore can''t make valid authorization decisions. When
  identity domains are in use, then all providers MBeans of the following types must
  be identity-domain-aware, and implement the interface:</p>  <ul> <li><code>Role
  Mapping</code></li> <li><code>Authorization</code></li> <li><code>Credential Mapping</code></li>
  <li><code>Audit</code></li> </ul>  <p>Along with implementing the marker interface,
  identity-domain-aware providers must handle user and group principals properly when
  they carry identity domain values, including accounting for identity domain when
  testing for equality, and constructing map keys that account for identity domain.
  Identity-domain-aware must also account for resource ownership properly.</p> '
