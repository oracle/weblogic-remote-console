  descriptionHTML: 'All the defined Work Managers. <p> A note about dynamic additions
    and deletions of Work Managers in a running server. Only applications or modules
    deployed or re-deployed after the changes are made can pick up newly added Work
    Managers. Existing production applications resolve their dispatch-policies to
    Work Managers during deployment time. Once the application is exported and in
    production mode, the server does not swap Work Managers. The tight binding helps
    performance and also avoids issues such as what happens to inflight work in the
    old Work Manager. This attribute is marked as dynamic so that new applications
    (re)deployed can pick up the Work Manager changes. Please note that this applies
    only to resolving dispatch-policies to Work Managers. Existing attributes within
    a Work Manager, like fair-share and constraints, can be modified without requiring
    a redeploy. </p> '
