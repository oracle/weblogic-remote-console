descriptionHTML: '<p>This interface contains accessor methods for all query cache
  runtime information collected for an EJB. The cache miss counts need some explaining.
  A query-cache miss can occur due to one of the following reasons:</p>  <ul> <li>The
  query result was not found in the query-cache</li> <li>The query result has timed
  out</li> <li>A bean which satisfies the query wasnot found in the entity cache</li>
  <li>A query with relationship-caching turned on did not find the related-beans query
  result</li> <li>A query which loads multiple EJBs could not load one or more of
  them</li> </ul>  <p>To better aid tuning, there are separate counters provided for
  each of the last four of the above causes. The fifth counter is a total cache miss
  counter. This counter takes into account all five causes of a cache miss.</p> '
