descriptionHTML: '<p>This MBean defines the minimum number of concurrent threads that
  should allocated to this constraint provided there are enough pending requests.</p>  <p>
  Multiple WorkManagers can share a common MinThreadsConstraint. MinThreadsConstraint
  perform their own bookkeeping and demand a thread when the constraint is not met
  and there are enough requests. </p>  <p> MinThreadsConstraint should be used to
  tell the WebLogic Server that a certain number of minimum threads are necessary
  to prevent server to server deadlocks. Although the server is self-tuning, specifying
  MinThreadsConstraint ensures that the server guarantees minimum threads to avoid
  the distributed deadlocks. </p> '
