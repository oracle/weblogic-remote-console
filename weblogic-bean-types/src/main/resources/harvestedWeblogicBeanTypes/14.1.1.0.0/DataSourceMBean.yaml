    Values are: <ul> <li>Secure: All incoming JDBC calls require administrator authentication.
    All other subjects, including anonymous, are rejected. Requires a configured SSL
    listen port.</li> <li>Compatibility: Use an insecure channel with the application''s
    subject and no check for inbound administrator authentication when using RMI to
    access a data source. This setting reflects the legacy implementation behavior
    for RMI access to a data source and is a potential security vulnerability as it
    provides a client uncontrolled access to a database.</li> <li>The default value
