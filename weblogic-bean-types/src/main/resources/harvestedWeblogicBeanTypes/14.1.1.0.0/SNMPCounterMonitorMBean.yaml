    each time the agent polls the monitored attribute and its value still exceeds

    of the modulus is subtracted from the threshold each time the threshold is crossed.</p> '

  descriptionHTML: '<p>Specifies a value that triggers the Counter Monitor to generate
    a notification.</p>  <p>The monitor generates a notification the first time the
    observed value transitions from below the threshold to at or above the threshold.
    While the observed value remains at or above the threshold, the Counter Monitor
    does not generate additional notifications. If the observed value falls below
    the threshold and then later equals or exceeds the threshold, the SNMP Counter
    Monitor will generate a notification every time the threshold is crossed.</p>  <p>You
    can specify an offset value to cause this threshold value to increase each time
    the observed value equals or exceeds the threshold. The first time the observed
    value equals or exceeds the new threshold value, this monitor generates a notification
    and adds the offset value to the new threshold value.</p>  <p>For example, if
    you set Threshold to 1000 and Offset to 2000, when the observed attribute equals
    or exceeds 1000, the Counter Monitor sends a notification and increases the threshold
    to 3000. When the observed attribute equals or exceeds 3000, the Counter Monitor
    sends a notification and increases the threshold again to 5000.</p> '
