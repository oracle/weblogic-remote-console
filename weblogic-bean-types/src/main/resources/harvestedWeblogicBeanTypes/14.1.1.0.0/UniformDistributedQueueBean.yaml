descriptionHTML: '<p>A uniform distributed queue is a distributed queue whose members
  are configured as part of its configuration; since members share the same configuration,
  they are uniform.  There is one member on each JMS Server that conforms to the targeting
  criteria of the uniform distributed queue.  For example, if a uniform distributed
  queue is targeted to a cluster, then one member will be created on each JMS server
  in the cluster. Members are created and destroyed as the targeting is changed.</p> '
