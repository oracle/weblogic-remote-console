descriptionHTML: '<p> This mbean is used to create Trigger (Usage limit) based policies
  for a resource type. </p> <p> Trigger (Usage limit) based policies allows a system
  administrator to establish usage limits, and define recourse actions that must be
  executed when those usage limits are breached. </p> <p> A trigger is a static upper-limit
  of usage of a resource. When the consumption of that resource crosses the specified
  limit, the specified recourse action is performed. This policy type is best suited
  for environments where the resource usage by Domain Partitions are predictable.
  </p> <p> As an example, a system administrator may limit the "Bayland" Partition
  to not use more than 100 open files, by setting a Trigger for 100 units of the "File
  Open" resource type in the resource-manager for the "Bayland" Partition. </p> <p>
  <b>Recourse Actions</b> </p> <p> The following recourse actions may be configured
  when a resource''s trigger value is breached: </p> <ul> <li><b>notify</b>: A Notification
  is provided to system administrators as an informational update of the trigger being
  breached.</li> <li><b>slow</b>: Throttle (typically slow-down) the rate at which
  the resource is consumed.</li> <li><b>fail</b>: Fail one or more resource consumption
  requests, usually until usage is below the desired limit.</li> <li><b>shutdown</b>:
  Attempts to stop resource consumption by initiating the shutdown sequence of the
  Domain Partition while allowing cleanup.</li> </ul> <p> The following requirements
  are validated during trigger creation: </p> <ol> <li>The set of recourse actions
  listed above are not valid for all resource types. The resource type MBean''s class
  document lists the subset of valid recourse actions that may be specified for that
  resource type. The specified recouse action for a resource type must be within that
  valid subset of recourse actions.</li> <li>Atmost one <i>shutdown</i> recourse action
  may be specified for a resource type.</li> <li>Atmost one <i>slow</i> recourse action
  may be specified for a resource type.</li> <li>Atmost one <i>fail</i> recourse action
  may be specified for a resource type.</li> <li>A <i>slow</i> recourse action cannot
  be specified for a resource type if a fair share policy is also defined for that
  resource type.</li> </ol> <p> Trigger creation is failed if any of these requirements
  fail. </p> '
