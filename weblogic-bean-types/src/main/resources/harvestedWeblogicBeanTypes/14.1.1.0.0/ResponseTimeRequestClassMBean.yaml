descriptionHTML: 'This MBean defines the response time goal for this request class.  <p>
  Response time goals can be used to differentiate request classes. We do not try
  to meet a response time goal for an individual request. Rather we compute a tolerable
  waiting time for a request class by subtracting the observed average thread use
  time. Then we schedule requests so that the average wait for each request class
  is in proportion to their tolerable waiting time. For example, consider we only
  have two request classes, A and B, with response time goals 2000ms and 5000ms, respectively,
  where the time an individual request uses a thread is much smaller. During a period
  in which both request classes are sufficiently requested, say, zero think time and
  more clients than threads, we schedule to keep the average response time in the
  ratio 2:5 so that it is a common fraction or multiple of the stated goal. </p> '

    define a response time goal or keep the -1 default value, which acts as a placeholder
    for the response time goal. By doing so, you have not defined the response time
    goal at run time but can define one later. </p> '
