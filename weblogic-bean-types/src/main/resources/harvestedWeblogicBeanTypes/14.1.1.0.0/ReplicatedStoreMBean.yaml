  Replicated Store is a high performance storage option for Exalogic hosted Weblogic
  Messaging Services and is an alternative to WebLogic Server''s File and JDBC persistent
  storage options. Replicated stores depend on Exalogic replicated memory that is
  managed by a separately administered Daemon Cluster that must be started before
  a WebLogic Replicated Store can boot.</p>  <p> See <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=wls14110&amp;id=WLEXA221"

  in Administering WebLogic Server for Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud.</p>  <p>This
  feature should be used only in Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud environments.</p>  <p>DEPRECATION
  NOTICE: With WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 and with the Exalogic X6 initial release,
  the WebLogic Replicated Store for JMS messages is deprecated. It will be removed
  in a future release. Oracle recommends that you use either a custom file store or
  a JDBC store for JMS message storage. See &quot;Administering the WebLogic Persistent
  Store&quot; in the documentation for more information about these options.</p> '
