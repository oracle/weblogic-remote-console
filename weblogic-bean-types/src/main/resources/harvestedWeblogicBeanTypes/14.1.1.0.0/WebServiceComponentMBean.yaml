descriptionHTML: '<p>Provides the interface used to configure a Web service that is
  deployed on a WebLogic Server instance.</p>  <p>A Web service is a special kind
  of Java EE Web Application that contains an additional deployment descriptor, web-services.xml,
  that describes the Web service. Because a Web service is packaged as a Java EE Web
  application, its component MBean is the same as that of a Web application, and thus
  simply extends the WebAppComponentMBean interface, adding no new methods.</p>  <p>WebLogic
  Server instantiates this interface only when you deploy a Web service.</p>  <p>This
  interface can configure Web services that are deployed as WAR files or exploded
  directories.</p> '
