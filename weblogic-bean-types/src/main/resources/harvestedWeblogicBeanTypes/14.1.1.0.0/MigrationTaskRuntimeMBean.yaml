descriptionHTML: '<p>Exposes monitoring information about an ongoing and potentially
  long-running administrative process.  This should be taken to mean, at minimum,
  any OAM operation involving IO.  Examples include starting and stopping servers,
  deploying and undeploying applications, or migrating services.</p>  <p>An MBean
  operation method of this sort should place the actual work on an ExecuteQueue and
  immediately return an instance of TaskRuntimeMBean to the caller.  The caller can
  then use this to track the task''s progress as desired, and if appropriate, provide
  facilities for user interaction with the task, e.g. "cancel" or "continue anyway."  OA&M
  clients can also query for all instances of TaskRuntimeMBean to get a summary of
  both currently-running and recently-completed tasks.</p> <p>Instance of TaskRuntimeMBean
  continue to exist in the MBeanServer after the completion of the work they describe.  They
  will eventually either be explicitly deregistered by an OA&M client, or removed
  by a scavenger process which periodically purges TaskRuntimeMBeans that have been
  completed for some time.</p> '
