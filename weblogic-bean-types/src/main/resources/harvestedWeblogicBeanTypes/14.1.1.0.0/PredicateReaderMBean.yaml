descriptionHTML: 'This MBean reads data about predicates and their arguments.  This
  is a type-safe interface for a WebLogic Server MBean, which you can import into
  your client classes and access through <code>weblogic.management.MBeanHome</code>.
  As of 9.0, the <code>MBeanHome</code> interface and all type-safe interfaces for
  WebLogic Server MBeans are deprecated. Instead, client classes that interact with
  WebLogic Server MBeans should use standard JMX design patterns in which clients
  use the <code>javax.management.MBeanServerConnection</code> interface to discover
  MBeans, attributes, and attribute types at runtime. '
