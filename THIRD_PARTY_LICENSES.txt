      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
For the avoidance of doubt:

Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways
otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of
the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all
rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject
to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used
under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for
licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under
specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary
for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation
to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses
grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a
licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other
rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking
that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our
licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
     Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
     otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright
     and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
     License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or
     sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed
     Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
     Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance
     with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
     broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without
     regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this
     Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not
     Copyright and Similar Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
     adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
     material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
     conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
     Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that
     the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
     this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
     that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
     public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
     communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
     public including in ways that members of the public may access the
     material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
     from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
     11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
     succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
     world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
     this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

  a. License grant.

     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
        Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
        not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
        conditions.

     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees
        not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
        technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
        including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
        making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
        Adapted Material.

     5. Downstream recipients.

        A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
           Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
           to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
           this Public License.
        B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
           additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
           Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
           so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of
           the Licensed Material.

     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
        endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
        designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
        this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
        waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
        Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
        Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
        waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
        the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
        You must:

        A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
           the Licensed Material:
           i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
              any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
              manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
              designated);
           ii. a copyright notice;
           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
           iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
           v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
              reasonably practicable;
        B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
           indication of any previous modifications; and
        C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
           License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
           this Public License.

     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
        Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
        conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
        the required information.

     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
        required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

     4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
        apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
        complying with this Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
     extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
     contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
     database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
     in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
     contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
     substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
     possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
     as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
     concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or
     other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
     absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
     of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of
     warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not
     apply to You.

  b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
     any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
     for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
     exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
     this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
     has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
     damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in
     part, this limitation may not apply to You.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
     shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
     closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
     Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
     License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
     automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

     1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
        cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

     2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
     the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
     License.

  d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
     Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
     Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
     Public License.

  e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
     conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
     Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
     and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
     be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
     use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
     permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
     unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
     shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
     enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
     to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
     limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply
     to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
     jurisdiction or authority.

No Copyright



CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
     and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
       depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
     a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
   the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
   detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
   shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
   any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
   by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
   is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
   non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
   unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
   the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
   in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
   purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
   promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
   of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
   License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
   applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
   invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
   affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
   and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
     including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
     other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
     discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
     any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
     disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
     or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
     CC0 or use of the Work.

# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
         Distributed under this Agreement, and

      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
         i) changes to the Program, and 
         ii) additions to the Program;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
      are not Modified Works.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
    or Modified Works thereof.

    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation source, and configuration files.

    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
    Contributor.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
      licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
      used for software exchange; and

      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
         for a particular purpose;

         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
         of this section 3.

    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
      the Program.

    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
    their own appropriate notices.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
    participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
    those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
    Contributions) under the new version.

    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
      look for such a notice.

      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
    Boston, MA 02110-1335
    USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
    is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
        is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
    along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
    Program or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
    a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
    limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
    Free Software Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
        Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
        General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
        James Hacker.

        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
        Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
    General Public License instead of this License.

---

## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
    combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
    from your version.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
     if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
     compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
     Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
     Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
     ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
     come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
     Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
     notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
     first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
     from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
     Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
     end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
     have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
